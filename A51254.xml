            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And counting the great things of his Law (even Chriſt the end of the Law, and the knowledge of God in Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, the things witneſſed in the Law and Prophets) as a ſtrange thing; were yet zealous in building Temples and multiplying Altars, and ſacrifices, <hi>Hoſ. 8. 11, 12 - 14.</hi> with <hi>ch. 6. 6, 7.

By the light of which he karned to relinquiſh the former apprehenſions he had of Chriſt, and ſo of other perſons, and things after the fleſh, or as that teacheth: and to account loſſe, and dung for Chriſt; and for the excellency of the knowledge of him, ſuch things, as before were gain to him; that he might farther win him, and be found in him. And ſo in receiving his word, as the word of God, and not of men, Chriſt (as te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the ſcriptures, the ſon of God, the Saviour of the world) became preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him. And having teſted, that the Lord is gracious (to whom comming as to a living ſtone, diſalowed indeed of men, but choſen of God and precious he alſo, as a lively ſtone was therein built up in him, and ſo made of the ſpirituall houſe, and holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable to God, by Jeſus Chriſt, the love of Chriſt conſtrained him, with much earneſtneſſe, to perſwade and beſeech others to be reconciled to God, and to ſeeke help in the name of God in Chriſt, to warne the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, ſupport the weake, to be patient towards all men, in meekneſſe inſtructing them that oppoſe themſelves: and to encourage, and ſtir up ſuch, as had believed through grace, to abide in him

as they had received him, and to provoke them to love, and good works and ſo to help forward, and ſtrengthen the hearts, and hands of the fellow-helpers to the truth. As one that had his heart ſeaſoned with thoſe principles of certainty, and truth, that one died for all, ſo effectually with the father that all have died in that death of one, as all have ſinned, and death paſſed on them, in and by the ſin of one. And that he therefore died for all, that they which live in their ſeverall ages, by the grace of God, bringing ſalvation to them, (as it doth to all men in due time) ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that dyed for them, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; knowing alſo in this knowledge of the greatneſſe, and truth of Gods grace in Chriſt to manward, the unſpeakable terror of the Lord againſt thoſe that will not know him, but are contentious, and do not obey the truth, or by an evil heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief depart from him, and go on in their treſpaſſes, and backslidings, till the day of grace paſs, and the maſter of the houſe be riſſen up, and have ſhut to the dore.</p>

This though much upon his ſpirit, to his latter end. Yet was too little conſidered by us.

            <p>It was therefore much ſet upon my ſpirit, on this occaſion, to apply my ſelfe to ſome conſideration of the voice of the rod in theſe inſtructions.

            <p>I know its too generally in high account with men, even with many profeſsing godlineſs, it goes under the name of a great virtue, and ſtrength of faith and patience, and a note of having much rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Lord: To paſs under ſuch liftings up of Gods hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſe, or rather inſtead of being humbled under them, to paſs over them lightly, as if they felt nothing, not wiſely conſidering the Work of the Lord, nor minding, or attending to know the meaning of ſuch voices.</p>

            <p>And ſo the patience and comfort of the Scriptures is ſuch, as in which the heart is exerciſed under, and by the tryals and afflictions, to a ſilent and digilent looking unto the Lord, a quick apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diſpleaſure when teſtified, falling down under it, and awaking to ſearch and try our wayes, that we may underſtand the meaning of the voice, even where yet we ſee it not, That ſo we may not fail of the grace of God.</p>
            <p>In the Text we have, 1. An evil of puniſhment, a heavy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and correction bewailed, yet taken out of Gods hand. The Lord our God hath made a Breach upon us.</p>

and acknowledged, as found with them the Survivers, and as being as on their parts the procuring cauſe of the judgement, for that we ſought him not after the due order.</p>
            <p>In both parts it affords us much inſtruction ſuitable to our preſent occaſion, though there is ſome difference between the manner of the correction or judgement, occaſioning the lamentation and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement in the Text, and that now to be bewailed by us.</p>
            <p>That was the cutting off an uſeful member by a ſudden ſtroke, the taking away from us one probably more uſefull by pining ſickneſs, like that threatned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 2.</p>
            <p>That was in ſignal teſtimony of diſpleaſure, not onely to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivers, but alſo to him that was cut off, which is more then can be ſaid of this. Yea this was by ſickneſs, as may be ſuppoſed, occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by, and for the work of Chriſt, if not alſo to ſupply ſome neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and lack of ſervice on others part, for which he ought to be held in greater reputation, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 29, 30.</p>
            <p>Yet hath it not in it the leſs but the more ſignal teſtimony of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to us. And however this Text ſuits our occaſion; it being not a declaration or mention of the correction in that ſtroke to <hi>

            <p>4 Yet the Lord is our God, when ſo provoked by ſuch iniquities, and while ſo puniſhing us; there is yet forgiveneſs with him and help in him, that he may be feared, and hoped in by us while it is to day; That we may turn to him from whom we have deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted.</p>

            <p>1 The Providences, or judgements under conſideration, are ſuch, as in which Righteous, Good, and Upright men, are cut off, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from us in the midſt of their dayes, or before they have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up their years; or in the midſt of ſome good work, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting and carrying on the deſign of Chriſt in the World, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ſuch are ſo taken away as therein, that generation, or kind of perſons are made thin, or made to fail, as when ſuch of them as were more eminently uſefull, in gathering and keeping others toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in companies or cluſters, and in ſtirring up believers with full purpoſe of heart to cleave to the Lord, and ſtrive together for the faith of the Goſpel are taken away, and no others of like uſefulneſs, and faithfulneſs, left or raiſed up in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>For more full underſtanding and uſefulneſs of this, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider diſtinctly. 1 What manner of perſons they are, whoſe being ſo removed make ſuch Breaches. 2 What manner of removal or taking away of ſuch perſons, is eſpecially ſo to be looked upon by us.</p>
            <p>1 The perſons whoſe being taken away and periſhing from the earth is ſuch a woe and affliction, or judgement upon others, the Survivers are in other Scriptures thus expreſſed. Righteous, and merciful men, Godly men, men of kindneſs, born of the kindneſs, and pity of God our Saviour towards man, and thence framed to ſome like mindedneſs, Good men, men full of the Holy Ghoſt, in his diſcovery and ſhedding abroad the love, and goodneſs of God in the teſtimony of Jeſus, and ſo full of faith of his operation, in which that goodneſs of God in Chriſt is believed, and their ſouls reſting ſatisfied, and rejoycing in it, and thence filled with all goodneſs, like their Heavenly Father, able alſo, and therein qualified, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh

one another, and to ſeek the good of all according to their capacity, <hi>Pſalm 12. 1. Iſaiah 57. 1. Mich.</hi> 7. 2. with <hi>Acts 11. 23, 24. Rom.</hi> 15. 13, 14. Such as are reconciled to God by Jeſus Chriſt, and have received into their hearts that word of reconciliation, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their treſpaſſes unto them, and in retaining it in their hearts, have it in ſome meaſure fitted in their lips, that with it they may perſwade others to be reconciled to God. (See farther for this the deſcription of righteous and merciful men, in the lamentation over the dead, publiſhed on the death of <hi>Henry Rix,</hi> and of the Doers of good, Doers of the truth, in the inſtruction to the living, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the death of <hi>Elizabeth Harriſon;</hi> in both which having ſpoken more largely to this point, I forbear it here, onely this we add.)</p>
            <p>The removing or periſhing of wicked and ungodly men, whether ſuch as are incenſed againſt the acknowledgement of the man Chriſt Jeſus, and of the excellent glory, the Father hath given him for us in the ſame body in which he bore our ſins on the tree, that by him our faith and hope might be in God, privily deſigning to caſt him down from his excellency: For ſuch as are contrary to the good of all men, being enemies in their minds to the riches and truth of Gods grace in and through Chriſt to man-ward, and therefore ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eclipſe, hinder, and caſt mire and dirt upon the ſincere Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of it, as alſo upon the faithful confeſſors of it, that hold it faſt, and hold it forth, without hidden things of diſhoneſty.</p>
            <p>Or ſuch as otherwiſe in their principles and works deny him, or do not love, eſteem, and worſhip him, or come to God by him, nor ſeek the lifting him up, but turn the grace of God in that unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gift into wantonneſs; turn his glory into ſhame, loving vanity, and ſeeking after lyes. I ſay the removing or cutting off ſuch from the earth cannot come under this conſideration, as a woe, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or judgement to the Survivers, their being ſo cut off, is a heavy judgement to themſelves, becauſe they are therein cut off for ever, and driven away in their wickedneſs into utter darkneſs. From the time of their death their is a great Gulf fixed, that they can never return to any mercy, or door of hope, but periſh for ever without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regarding it; which ſhould teach us not to deſire ſuch a wofull day, becauſe ſo woful to them, nor to haſten from following him in ſeeking their good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
            <p>But the periſhing of ſuch is ſo far from being a judgement of this nature to others, That on the other hand, as when they riſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, or bear rule a man is hidden, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 12. Even the man Chriſt is hidden, his viſage more marred then any mans, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100080:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the man that is godly, and ſo ſuch as are valiant for the truth, and have quit themſelves thereto, like men from thoſe divers entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and luſts that weaken; They are ſought for to be ſuppreſſed, kept under and hidden, yea men, not onely ſuch, but even all that in any ſenſe quit themſelves like men, and will not ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their principles and traditions are faine to hide themſelves: And therefore thereby the people generally have cauſe of mourning, ſo when they periſh the righteous increaſe, and it goeth well with them, and thereby the people rejoyce, and there is ſhouting. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 12, 28. and 29. 2. and 11. 10.</p>
            <p>But they are the righteous, even ſuch as have righteouſneſs, and ſtrength in the Lord, ſeeking it there by faith in him, that ceaſing from their own works in the light and power of his teſtimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, having raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the Dead, who was delivered for our offences, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again for our juſtification. They are ſuch, as having taſted that the Lord is gracious do cleave to him with full purpoſe of heart, and are by his goodneſs retained in the midſt of their hearts, fitted, and apted with earneſtneſs to ſtir up others ſo to do. Such they are whoſe being taken away out of this life in the fleſh, is to themſelves great gain, whoſe removal from us is to the Survivers generally great loſs; a heavy woe and affliction, whether they be ſenſible of it, or no.</p>
            <p>Becauſe ſuch men are through the grace in Chriſt received and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them in its own light, and power qualified to mind, and ſeek the promoting of the things of Chriſt in the World, and ſo the good of others therein, and are therefore ſet and preſerved in the World to that purpoſe. To them to live is Chriſt, it tends to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth and magnifying him, and ſo to the carrying on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and buſineſs in the World; To die is to themſelves gain and advantage, but that reaches but to themſelves; and ſo the affliction and judgement in the removal of ſuch is greater, as they were more one with him in his deſign, not ſeeking their own things, but the things which be Jeſus Chriſts.</p>
            <p>2 The manner of removing, or taking away of ſuch perſons, that is eſpecially to be looked upon by us, as ſuch a woe and affliction in which evil Breaches are made upon us; It is not ſimply, or onely their being taken away by death, for its appointed to men, the whole kind, once to die, and that firſt death is ſo aboliſhed, the ſting and wrath ſo taken out of it, that no man ſhall periſh or be holden for, ever in that, nor is it in himſelf ſimply a judgement in wrath or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to themſelves, or others for any man once to die. But when death ſeizes them, or they are ſnacht away by it unſeaſonably, or before the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100080:8"/>
time, or when it is in ſome ſignal teſtimony of diſpleaſure, then it is a correction or judgement either to themſelves or to others, or to both.</p>
            <p>Now that men may die before their time, that they may ſhorten their dayes though they cannot lengthen them, or that the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or cutting them off in the midſt, or before the appointed time, may by ſome means be procured to them, is evident in the Scripture: There is (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) an appointed time to man upon earth the number of his Moneths or Dayes are with God, beyond which he cannot paſs. Alſo his dayes are like the dayes of an hireling (Of which a forfeiture may be made to the ſhortning them.) Therefore he ſaith, All the Dayes of of his appointed time he would wait till his change came: (not haſting his end as he was councelled by his wife, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 9.) And begs of God to turn from him (namely his wrath, or not to ſet his iniquities before him, his ſecret ſins in the light of his countenance, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90. 7, 8, 9.) That he might reſt, (or be ſpared a little to recover ſtrength, and not conſumed, or cut off by the blow of his hand, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39. 10, 13.) till he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh as an hireling his day, <hi>Job.</hi> 7. 1. and 14. 5, 6. 14. See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that caution <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 17. Why ſhouldſt thou die before thy time. Of like import to this purpoſe is that ſaying of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> That in the cutting off his Dayes threatned, he was deprived of the reſidue of his years, his age was departed from him, he had cut off like a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his life, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 38. 10. 12.</p>
            <p>Yea we find that both good and righteous men, and alſo wicked and ungodly men may be cut off, and die before their appointed time.</p>
            <p>But this difference is alwayes to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>The cutting off wicked and ungodly men is alwayes mentioned as a judgement upon themſelves, ſuch as in which they are utterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut off from all hope, &amp; driven away in their wickedneſs; but not as a judgment or evil breach, or wo to the ſurvivers. Yea rather ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences are mentioned, as having favor and mercy in them towards others from amongſt whom ſuch are cut off: As <hi>Sauls</hi> being cuting off, was in wrath to himſelf, but in mercy to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> cut off in judgement to themſelves; but there being cut off, was no evil breach upon others, but on the other hand a ſignal manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods taking part with the righteous, and pleading their cauſe for the good of others; ſo that doom generally threatned on ſuch men, as put forth their hands againſt thoſe that be at peace with them, break the covenant, are bloody, and deceitful men, as <hi>Judas, Ahitophel,</hi> and others, that they ſhall not live out half their dayes, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 55. 20, 23. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> mentioned as Gods faithfulneſs and mercy to the righteous for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100080:9"/>
their ſuſtaining, and that they may not be moved by their afflictions afflictions they ſuffer from ſuch, and by the general proſperity of ſuch, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>David</hi> almoſt was, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 7. 3.</p>
            <p>Whereas when ever the cutting off righteous and good men in the midſt of their dayes, or depriving of the reſidue of their years, is ſpoken of, its alwayes mentioned as an evil breach, a heavy wo and judgement to the ſurvivers procured by their iniquities, yea though ſometimes ſuch providences have in them ſome preſent correction to themſelves ſo cut off, for ſome error or miſcarriage in which they have not ſanctified him before others, as in the caſe of <hi>Moſes, Joſiah,</hi> and here <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah;</hi> and that threatned on <hi>Hezekiah</hi> yet. Firſt, That correction is not in wrath, or ſuch as in which they are cut off from God, or from their hope, onely from their further opportunity of praiſing him to the living, and ſo of bringing forth more fruit that might appear on their account at the day of Chriſt, which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent correction and affliction to a gracious ſoul, though the end of corrections to them, and redounds to their own private gain and advantage.</p>
            <p>Again ſecondly, God would never ſo correct them for ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, by cutting them off in the midſt of their dayes, and depriving them of the reſidue of their years, if he had not a controverſie with others, the people from whom ſuch are moved and taken: It was for the Peoples ſakes that God was angry with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and took him away (as before we ſnewed) ſo it was in judgement, and wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and for their grievous ſins and rebellions, that God corrected <hi>Joſiah</hi> for his raſhneſs by cutting him off. See the whole book of the Lamentations.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe for the iniquities found with the <hi>Corinths,</hi> even theſe that yet ſurvived, for their not ſo diſcerning the Lords body, as to examine and judge themſelves in the inſtructions and reproots of it, many from among them ſlept, or were taken away by death, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to the reſt, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 11. 30. And ſuch are the providences in which God is making evil breaches upon a people, and they are ſuch breaches and judgements to the ſurvivers, whether there were any correction or diſpleaſure teſtified unto them taken away, or no; when ſuch as before good and righteous men are cut off in the midſt of their daye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or deprived of the reſidue of their years, as in that threatned on <hi>Hezekiah, Iſaiah,</hi> 38. and as it may ſeem on <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſalm</hi> 39. 10, 13.</p>
            <p>Or when by ſome ſudden ſtroke, or in ſignal teſtimony of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, they are cut off in the midſt of ſome good work; they had been eminently inſtrumental in beginning, and promoting, as <hi>Moſes, Joſiah,</hi> and here <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> eſpecially when others of like uſefulneſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100080:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and faithfulneſs are not found ſurviving, or timely raiſed up in their ſtead, yea however they are taken away though in a good old age; yet when that kind or generation of men periſh, and decay from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, that they are ſo many the fewer, as there is taken away by death. And eſpecially when ſuch as were chiefly inſtrumental for ſtirring up others to ſeek the Lord, and with full purpoſe of heart to cleave to him, and ſo for gathering and keeping others in cluſters, fail from among men; that its hard to finde one in ſuch a ſenſe good and upright, but all are ſeeking their own things, and not the things which be Jeſus Chriſts. Theſe are the providences and breaches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, in which God is making evil breaches, executing ſad judgements on the ſurvivers.</p>
            <p>2 We come next to conſider what manner of breaches, ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences do make, and on whom.</p>
            <p>1 They are breaches made in the Wall, or Hedge, or do make ſuch breaches.</p>
            <p>1 Upon all generally in the Nations, Places, and Families, amongſt whom they had their converſation, and from amongſt whom they are taken.</p>
            <p>To the making away for Gods anger to be poured out in deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting judgements to the deſtruction or cutting off a people, or in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtrong deluſions to them, and leaving them to their own hearts luſts, that they might be damned, <hi>Pſalm 78. 50. Iſaiah</hi> 59. 4, 18. and 64. 7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 1. For while they are preſerved amongſt men. They are ſet to ſeek the Peace, and good of all men, to make ſuppl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, prayers, and interceſſions for all men, that they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to ſtand in the gap to keep off judgen en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; and the effectual ſervent prayer of the righteous availeth much, yea, by the exerciſe of their wiſdome in the knowledge of God in Chriſt, they though poor and deſpiſed, are made inſtruments of delivering the place and City where they live: Therefore their periſhing from the earth, is a ſign and fore-runner of greater evils and j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dgments to come, if not timely prevented by turning to him that ſmites.</p>
            <p>2 To the leaving evil and ungodly men at liberty, without ſenſe or controle to run on, and prevail alſo with their ungodly princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and works, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 12. When the godly man ceaſeth, and faithful ones fail from among the children of men, then they, the children of men ſpeak vanity every one with his neighbour, with a flattering lip and double heart do they ſpeak, encouraging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to prevail with their Lip, Word, or Doctrine: For ſay they; Who is Lord over us? Who ſhall controle, or hinder us, or ſtop our mouths? The godly and faithful being failed from among them, who it ſeems had power in their right words and works (which are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100080:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſtop the mouths of Gain-ſayers, and hinder the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and ſpreading of their Lip, even by ſound Doctrine, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo in a good converſation in Chriſt, for they would not ſeek to do it by a worldly power if they had opportunity, nor by the wrath of man.</p>
            <p>Yea it followes in the cloſe of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſtill as the iſſue of this judgment: The wicked walk on every ſide, when the vileſt men are exalted. So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57. 3, 4. with <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. we read, That on the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the righteous &amp; good men from the earth, the ſeed of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſs, of the Adulterer, and Whore, ſport themſelves, and draw out a wide mouth; they rejoyce to do evil with both hands, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly laying in wait for blood, hunting every man his brother with a net; encouraging themſelves now eaſily to prevail over thoſe nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and feeble ones, that are ſighing under Gods judgments, and to blot out their name from under heaven, that it be no more a hindrance reproof, and check to them: For if the foundations be deſtroyed, ſay they, what can the righteous do? But our Rock is not like theirs, our foundation and ſanctuary is one, and cannot be deſtroyed, our God is in his holy Temple; The Lords Throne is in Heaven: A glorious high Throne is the place of our ſanctuary, <hi>Pſalm 11. Jer.</hi> 17. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Therefore rejoyce not againſt me, Oh mine enemies, ſaith <hi>Michah, chap.</hi> 7. 9. When I fall, I ſhall ariſe, becauſe the Lord liveth, who is the Rock of my ſalvation, and will be a light to me, even when good men are periſhed from the earth, and in that reſpect I am made to ſit in darkneſs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 47. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 1, 2, 3, 46. with <hi>Mich.</hi> 7 7, 8, 9. even ſo the true believer of Gods teſtimony, exerciſing faith in Chriſt according to it, hath yet encouragement in the Lord his God.</p>
            <p>But evil and ungodly men take liberty, and rejoyce to do evil (as before) boaſting themſelves of their hearts deſire, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging themſelves in hope of prevailing, upon the ceaſing of faithful men from amongſt them, for while they were preſerved among them; They were by the word of life put in their heart, held forth in word and converſation unto them, and amongſt them, as a fenced Brazen Wall; againſt which, though fighting, they could never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. But they the faithful or upright ones, were mighty through God by the power of their word, to turn their waters or doctrines into blood, that men could not drink them, or not find reſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in them, for the Lord was with them, as a mighty, and terrible One, making their witneſs held forth in word and converſation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo powerfull as was affirmed of <hi>Jeremie</hi> of old, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 7. 10, 17, 18, 19. and 15, 19, 20, 21. with <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 27, 28, 29, 30. And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100080:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might not be altogether unduely applyed here.</p>
            <p>2 Such providences are alſo as breaches, in the hedge, wall, or ſence to ſuch as are left of Gods peculiar people, even to the flock of God, the Church, or Congregation, that he hath gathered or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from among men, through that excellent price the precious blood of Chriſt, ſet before them and opened to them, by the ſpirit in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>1 To the laying them open to be waſted, ſpoiled, and troden down by Bores and wild Beaſts, in the likeneſs of men, who now will enter in amongſt them without let or hindrance to corrupt and deſtroy. I know, ſais <hi>Paul,</hi> that after my departure ſhall grievous Wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock, alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things to draw away Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after them, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29, 30.</p>
            <p>While ſuch powerfull and faithful inſtruments are continued with and amongſt the flock, they are mighty through God, to the keeping out and driving away ſuch hurtfull Wolves, and falſe brethren that come to bring into bondage, to whom they will not give place by ſubjection to them; no not for an hour, that the truth of the Goſpel may continue with the flock of God, over whom the Holy Ghoſt hath made them overſeers, and that it may therefore and ſo remain with them, that it may be held forth by them for the good of others.</p>
            <p>They being furniſhed with that faithful word, the word of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, the preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt, he is Lord of all, with which they are able through God to ſtop the mouths of gain-ſayers, and of ſuch vain and unruly talkers, and ſo to hinder them in their enterprize of ſubverting whole houſes, being thereby fully inſtructed and ſtrengthned to every good word and work.</p>
            <p>Their removal therefore is an evil breach to the letting in ſuch to waſte and deſtroy this Vine, <hi>Pſalm 80. 13. Iſaiah.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>2 Alſo to the letting out or adminiſtring occaſion of diſheartning to the weak and wavering, leaving them as without watch or guard, to their aptneſs to take offence and ſtumble at they know not what; and ſo to turn away their ears from the truth, and be tumbled aſide to fables, ſuch as did watch over them and ſeek to heal, help, and ſtrengthen them at all occaſions, being removed and failing from them. Many will be eaſily enticed to follow the pernicious wayes of the ſpirit of Antichriſt; by reaſon of whom the way of truth will be evil ſpoken of, and the enemy will more rejoyce, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 2, 3, 4, 6. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 13, 14. with <hi>chap. 2. 1. 2. Acts 20. 30. Pſal. 12. Mich.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>2 Such providences are like a breach in the natural body, as the cutting off an uſefull member, until the making up; or healing of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100080:11"/>
which there can be no profitable or cheerful progreſs in the work, for if all the members ſuffer in the ſuffering of one, their ſuffering and affliction muſt needs be greater in the loſs of one, by its being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or cut off from being any more uſefull, or ſerviceable to, or in the body in this time of temptation. Whence <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus,</hi> as his brother and companion in labours, and fellow-ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and their meſſenger ſignifies, that his being taken away by death as was threatned, would have been not onely to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> but to himſelf alſo a very great affliction, adding ſorrow upon ſorrow. Yea,</p>
            <p>3 Being breaches of ſuch a nature, they muſt needs occaſion a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent breach in, and ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ppage to the good work, the work of the Lord to be carryed on by the Church in the world, until it be made up or healed; as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah's</hi> being thus cut off by a ſudden ſtroke, chiefly procures by their iniquities, occaſioned a breach in, and put a ſtop to their work of bringing home the Ark of God for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and till they had ſearched and ſound the iniquity reproved, and their hearts were prepared to ſeek the Lord after the due order, as we ſee by comparing the 13. <hi>chap.</hi> With this we may fitly apply what hath been ſaid, to our preſent occaſion of lamentation. The taking away of this our <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the midſt of his dayes, depriving him, or rather us of the reſidue of his years, and at ſuch a time in the midſt; or rather in the beginning of his zealous indeavours to the promoting of ſo glorious a work, as the Publiſhing and Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glorious name and grace of God in Chriſt to man-ward, and earneſt preſſing and ſtirring up the people of God, to joyn as one man with full purpoſe of heart to cleave to the Lord, ſtriving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his name after the due order for the faith of the Goſpel, and in nothing terrified by their adverſaries, his being taken from us being alſo in ſuch an evil time, when ſo few like minded, not ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own things, but the things which be Jeſus Chriſts. This is ſurely a very great and grievous breach made upon us in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned conſiderations, ſomething near to that, <hi>Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It preſents us with abundant cauſe and matter of lamentation and bitter weeping for our ſelves, and the miſeries that are like to follow upon us, if not timely prevented by turning to him that ſmites us, with whom onely is healing. 'Tis a day of trouble, of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord God of hoſts in the valley of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion,</hi> breaking down the wall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He hath made us to ſee the breaches of the City of <hi>David, Iſaiah</hi> 22. 5, 9.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100080:11"/>
a ſpirit lifted up, or carried away from the ſenſe of the affliction as thoſe people were by a conceit of their ability and ſtrength, yet to make up the breaches in the wall by pulling down the houſes. But with fear and trembling let us look unto the maker thereof, and with reverence have reſpect to him that faſhioned it long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe. For,</p>
            <p>2 It is he, even the Lord, that is the maker of ſuch breaches in it.</p>
            <p>The Lord our God hath made this breach upon us.</p>
            <p>He is the authour of all evil of puniſhments or corrections of ſin: They are his work, though his ſtrange work (<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28. 21.) to which he is unwillingly provoked. It is not the work of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in this day of his grace and patience to prepare, and frame ſuch evil things againſt men: He delighteth in mercy, that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, he is the Father of lights, and therefore every good and perfect gift commeth down naturally and freely from him; but there is no darkneſs in him; Evil or wrath towards men, hath not its original in his gracious heart or councels, whence he is ſaid to frame and create it againſt men, as a thing without him, or that had not its original in him, but his ſtrange act, not framed againſt any till he be highly provoked to it.</p>
            <p>I the Lord form the light, and create darkneſs, I make peace, and create evil; I the Lord do all theſe things, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That darkneſs which he is ſaid to create, is darkneſs as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to light, Favour, Grace, and good things vouchſaled to men, and ſo evil, as oppoſed to peace, and not as oppoſed to good things done by men. Its not the evil of ſin that he frames or creates, that is their wayes, their doings, none of his, but the evil of puniſhment, as <hi>Amos</hi> 3 3. 6. You have I known above all the families of the earth, therefore you will I puniſh for all your iniquities. And of theſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for their iniquities, he ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. ſhall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it.</p>
            <p>Yea that he tempts no man with evil, nor can he be tempted, or moved to have any hand in, or fellowſhip with any thing that is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; no, not inmoving, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſhall not the Judge of all the earth do right; far be it from us to attribute any manner of cruelty, injuſtice, or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs to the Almighty: Yea, therefore to him of Right it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to execute vengeance upon all ungodly ſinners that deſpiſe him, and run to other Rocks, becauſe he is the Rock, his work is perfect.

Its his work, and he will do it ſeaſonably, and righteouſly, to puniſh the world for their iniquity, and the wicked for their ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
            <p>Of the evil of puniſhment for mens evils and iniquities, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and tryals for purging them: There are ſome of which God is more remotely the authour (<hi>viz.</hi>) Such as are executed by evil inſtruments, and in the execution of which the inſtruments do evil, or ſinfully: As thoſe many and great afflictions on <hi>Job. Shimeies</hi> curſing <hi>David,</hi> and the like, which yet they did well to take out of Gods hand, as his doing and ordering to them. But in ſuch judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as theſe; this cautionary diſtinction is well to be obſerved, God is the authour of the puniſhment to the party puniſhed, not of the ſinful action, of the inſtrument by whom he puniſheth. He hath no hand in or fellowſhip with the ſinful action of the inſtrument, in moving or promoting to it, or allowing, and approving of it, but yet is the Author &amp; orderer of the puniſhment, or correction, that is in the influence of ſuch evils on the ſubjects they fall upon by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting &amp; ordering ſuch influence of others evils to light upon them. And whatſoever he doth is holy, juſt, and good, and for the good of thoſe to whom he doth it, while it is to day, though in that which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the inſtruments do, the influence of which he permits to fall on others, they do evil, and ſinfully, and intend it for evil, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> well ſaid to his brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20. Yea thought it for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but God meant it for good. They envied and hated him, and thought to deſtroy him, God had no hand in that; but ſuffered their evil to have influence upon him, ſo far as might tend to the ſending him to <hi>Egipt,</hi> to preſerve them, and much people alive, They meant no ſuch thing in it, it was not they but God, that by that means ſent him thither, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 7, 8.

with them, in their ſinful thought and action. But he did ordain the influence of their wrath, and evils for righteous judgment, and for correction, that utter deſtruction to his people might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and ſo was holy and righteous in all his wayes, though they were wicked and ſinful in theirs, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 6. 12, 13</p>
            <p>And ſo generally, he hath made the wicked for the day of evil, and wrath, he makes no man wicked, but ſuch as make themſelves ſo, he hath made and ordered them to be in his hands to be uſed, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by him, in the influence of their wickedneſs, as rods to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute wrath on others for his own glory. They ſhall be kept in ſtore for judgements to execute ſuch judgements, as he delights not to imploy good Angels, and as they deſire not to be imployed in, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> 16. 4.</p>
            <p>God did not move <hi>Shemei</hi> to curſe, but <hi>Shemei</hi> hardning his heart againſt that grace that brings ſalvation to all men, which would have prevented him; and conceiving the evil and malitious thought, and luſt, which God approved not, nor came it into his mind (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 19. 5. and 32. 35.) And being at this time himſelf a fit perſon to be left or given up to his own hearts luſt (as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18 12. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66. 3, 4.) God now left him to it in juſt judgment to him, which though he did, he could yet have reſtrained the influence of it from falling on <hi>David,</hi> or turned it on his own Head, as after he did, or ſome other way; yet now he ſuffered it to light on <hi>David</hi> for good and holy ends. What God did in it was Holy and Good, and meant for good to <hi>David,</hi> though what <hi>Shimei</hi> did was ſinfull, and meant for evil; to which agrees that general affirmation.</p>
            <p>The wrath of man ſhall praiſe him. Note ſtill, its the wrath of man which directly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, or of it ſelf worketh not the righteouſneſs of God: But its of God to make it turn to his praiſe, and to reſtrain that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder thereof, which might not do ſo, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 76. 10. with <hi>James</hi> 1. 20.</p>
            <p>But there are other judgments for puniſhment, correction, and purging of ſin, that God is more immediately, and directly the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of, which he doth as it were by himſelf, without ſuch evident and viſible uſe or imployment of inſtruments, as in the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo is more properly and directly affirmed to be the maker of them, as, the with-holding rain, giving want of bread, ſmiting with blaſting and mil-dews, ſending the peſtilence after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Egipt,</hi> taking away their Horſes, and making the ſtink of their Camps to come up into their Noſtrils (a judgment now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onus) overthrowing ſome of them, as he overthrew <hi>Sodom, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 22. with <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 2, 6, 12. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14, 15.

Are more immediately, and directly his own hand, done by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without ſuch uſe of inſtruments, as before. So of that ſickneſs unto death and threatned with it on <hi>Hezekiah, Iſaiah</hi> 38. 1. He ſaith <hi>verſe</hi> 15. He, namely, the Lord, hath both ſpoken unto me, and himſelf hath done it.</p>
            <p>And of this latter ſort of judgments, is the breach ſpoken of in the Text, the Lord made it even by himſelf, without evident and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable uſe of inſtruments, by an immediate and ſudden ſtroke: And ſuch is alſo that which we have this day to lament, as to the immediate and direct hand of the maker in it, though he did it not by a ſudden ſtroke as there, but by pining ſickneſs, yet he hath done it himſelf, from day even to night, he hath made an end of him, as to us, and our preſent injoyment and perſonal uſefulneſs of him in this world.</p>
            <p>The Lord our God hath made this breach upon us. Let the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hereof be of uſe.</p>

            <p>The immediateneſs of his hand in it, leaves us the more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out room or colour to wander with our eyes into corners, or to reaſon or diſpute, indeed ſuch a behaviour under his hand when lifted up, is very evil, and unſeemly when yet its evident, evil inſtruments are i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But now his hand lifted up as it is, is more eminent to humble and meaken our ſpirits, and make us ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent before him: And it ſhews greater iniquity and hardneſs in it, if it have not that effect. If now we will be froward, or murmer, we have none to wrangle with or look upon but the Lord: If we would vindicate our ſelves, or ſeek to excuſe or plead our innocency, we have none whoſe judgment we might therein ſeek to diſanul.

Having obtained power in the name of the father ſo to execute judgment, becauſe he is the Son of man. It is the Lord, let him do what he will: Yea the Graciouſneſs, Faithfulneſs, and Goodneſs of his Government, and his worthineſs to be ſubmitted to, appears in this; That it is his Kingdom that ruleth over us, even in all things: That he hath not left us under the hand, will, or power, of our enemies, but ſtill we are in his hand, with whom is mercy and power, to ſave and heal.

            <p>3 This conſideration ſerves to warn and admoniſh us to be ſenſible of ſome diſpleaſure provoked, and ſome great reproof in it to us; That it may be diligently liſtned to and received by us: For though its much better to fall into the hands of the Lord, then into the hands of men, whoſe tender mercies are cruelties. Yet when taking us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hands, he is provoked to make ſuch breaches, to correct ſo ſharply himſelf, it bears witneſs againſt us of ſome great iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with us, and of much ſtubborneſs in hiding and retaining them, provoking ſuch diſpleaſure in ſuch a gracious God and Saviour.</p>
            <p>If he had given us over, or left us in the hands of men, and they had not ſpared nor pitied, but been cruel to the utmoſt they could; There might yet have been ſome room to have waved the reproof

of inſtruction in it, or to have ſtrengthned our ſelves in a thought, that there had been no ſuch reproof in it to us, or diſpleaſure from God ſignified againſt us. He might have ordered ſome light affliction to us, and they might (being alſo left to try them) have added to our affliction, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 15. But what ſhall we ſay? Himſelf hath done it, and by himſelf: The Lord that ſees many things to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke before he obſerve them againſt us, yea though he prevents al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with opening the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Lord, Gracious, Merciful, ſlow to Anger, ready to forgive; and that doth not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men, even he hath made this breach upon us: Who gave <hi>Jacob</hi> to the ſpoil and <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the robbers? Did not the Lord? Surely the Lord, our Holy and Gracious One, the glorious Lord would not have done it, if we had not exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>3 That the reaſon or procuring cauſe of ſuch judgments from the Lord, is our own iniquities; Yea that uſually there is found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the more general evils, ſome great iniquity of neglects, and diſorder in Gods peculiar people, yea even iniquity and pollution in their holy things as the in-let to, and procuring cauſe of ſuch judgments on themſelves and others.</p>

And for theſe with the former: God farther threatens, That when this, namely the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned judgment cometh to paſs, They ſhould alſo know that a Prophet had been among them (as may ſeem by the want of them.)

            <p>I might here mention the evils complained of, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56. which is principally their general envy at God people, by whom his houſe is rendred a houſe of prayer for all people, the blindneſs, greedineſs, profaneſs, and enmity of their watch-men, who were Ring-leaders in thoſe crooked pathes, which are declared as fore-runners and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers of ſuch judgments, as well as their multiplied idolatries, and cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet ſomething more we ſhall briefly add, to what is there alſo hinted of that plain declaration of the cauſe, why many among be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers were weak and ſickly, and many ſlept, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29, 30, 31.</p>
            <p>It was as appears by comparing the <hi>verſes</hi> 28. 31. For their not ſo diſcerning, conſidering, and looking into the Lords body, that was broken for them, and is now through ſufferings entered into his glory: As to examine themſelves in that glaſs, and judge themſelves thereby, as diſcovered and reproved in the light and powet of it; and ſo for their pride and diſorders, that followed on that in-let to all diſorder. For ſo much is evident from his councel; let a man examine himſelf, &amp; ſo let him eat, as that is preſſed with this motive or reaſon; For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks Damnation

(preſent reproof and correction) to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body, ſo much I ſay is evident.</p>
            <p>1 That the true way for a man rightly to examine himſelf is in the diſcerning the Lords body, as declared in the glorious Goſpel; looking to and into that as the true glaſs, that makes himſelf and all things elſe manifeſt in their right colours.</p>
            <p>2 That the want of, or the wilfull neglect, or ſhunning the ſo examining a mans ſelt in that glaſs, the unwillingneſs to ſee and judge himſelf, his own vileneſs and wretchedneſs, the evil, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own wayes, as therein diſcovered and reproved, is that iniquity, that renders him unworthy, or un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep.</p>
            <p>And this underſtanding is farther confirmed in what followes: For if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged. This ſhews us that the examining of a mans ſelf, to which we are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted is not to ſearch our own glory, which indeed is not glory, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 25 27. Nor to ſearch for, know, or take notice of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own frames or qualifications, as things rendring us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, or by which we may come, nor in this caſe, or to ſuch an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Gal.</hi> 3. 2, and 4. 15.) But if we had done all thoſe things, to which by grace made known through blood we are inſtructed and obliged, the ſame grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us therein alwayes to acknowledge our ſelves unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that have done but our duty, nothing in which we may be profitable to God, or procure the reward o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the examining our ſelves here, and in this caſe inſtructed to, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. is ſuch an examining our ſelves in that true glaſs, the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>verſe</hi> 29.

            <p>Not meaſuring himſelf by himſelf, what he is now, with what he was before, or with others, what he is more, or better then they; that he may have any thing of that nature to look upon or commend himſelf by. This was the evil way of the <hi>Corinths,</hi> that led them to deſpiſe ſuch as had not what they had.

The wilfull neglect and unwillingingneſs thus to examine and judge themſelves in an earneſt diſcerning (looking into and continuing in, as <hi>James</hi> 1. 23. 25.)

            <p>
               <hi>The Lord our God made this breach upon us, for that we ſought him not after the due order.</hi>

            <p>They ſought not the Lord after the due order, that with their mouth ſhewed much love, but their heart went after their covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33. 31.

            <p>There is an order in the time and cauſes of the things, that are to be preferred, and earneſtly, and in a ſenſe equally to be ſought for by us.

            <p>In their receiving him, they were baptized into the knowledge and acknowledgment of his death, and ſo taking root down-ward, believing, minding, and conſidering, what he had done, and was now become for them through the blood of his Croſs: They were

            <p>And ſo the way to grow in grace is ſignified to be, in growing in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8, 18.

            <p>And to that purpoſe, the firſt thing in all the commandements, as brought to us by the glorious Goſpel, is, to hear that word, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, that preſents the Lord our God to be one Lord, as evidenced in that one Mediator between God and men; the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſome for all, a teſtimony in due time, which ſhews him to be light, and in him no darkneſs at all.

            <p>And ſo the way to ſeek righteouſneſs profitably that we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, is to ſeek it by faith in Chriſt, <hi>Romans</hi> 9. 30, 32. To believe in him, that we may be juſtified by the faith of him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15, 16.

to conclude to themſelves, from ſome imagined gracious frames, good affection, victory over ſin, or the like; or from ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aſſurance, that hath no better ground for the bottom of it, then ſome teſtimony of their own, or ſome private ſpirit; before they will believe Gods teſtimony, of his ſending his onely begotten Son by his grace to taſte death for them, and giving him glory, that their faith and hope might be in God: And then gather up concluſions of the truth of that for them from their imagination of the truth of the former. Namely that Chriſt by the grace of God taſted death for them, becauſe they find themſelves ſuch as before. Hence it is, that the way men too generally walk in, to comfort themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in diſtreſs, is to labour to perſwade them, that they are in a better condition then they think they are. Their ſins leſs, their Hearts, Deſire, Frames, and Works better, or elſe from ſome ſigns or teſtimony of their owne ſpirit, or of others, that they are of the Elect, and that therefore Chriſt and all his things belong to them.</p>

            <p>Inſtead then of ſtriving to conclude thy ſelf in a good or ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſee and conſider in the teſtimony of Chriſt, what there is for ſuch as are in a bad and loſt condition (like the woman to whom our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Its not meet to caſt the Childrens Bread to Dogs:</hi> Truth Lord, ſayes ſhe, yet the Dogs eat the crums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) That being hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily conſidered, will bring the into a better condition: For God made him that knew no ſin, to be ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.

            <p>3 There is an order of regularneſs to be obſerved in the manner of our ſeeking. <hi>And ſo to ſeek the Lord after the Due Order,</hi> is to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that rule (in all our ſeeking) which is already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as that is grounded upon and opened by the word of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Chriſt, which is the viſion of all, the foundation of all ordinances of divine worſhip, and the key of knowledge for opening them, &amp; the particular precepts concerning them, and not to have our fear towards God taught by the precepts of men, which is an evil found with all thoſe worſhippers, or ſeekers, to whom the viſion of all is a ſealed book, who perceive not their ground in that, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their inſtructions from thence unto all their fear, and worſhip; but make the word of the Lord to them precept upon precept, line upon line, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>To ſeek him after the Due Order,</hi> as under this conſideration, is</p>
            <p>1 <hi>To ſeek him, fear, or worſhip him, remember, and acknowledge him,</hi> in his wayes, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 64. 5. not to chuſe our own wayes, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66. 3. or to receive our converſation in that reſpect from the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes or traditions of men, or to be determined by their precepts: That will render our worſhip vain, unacceptable, and fruitleſs, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew 15. 9. 1 Peter</hi> 1. 18. But in the inſtruction and direction of the Apoſtles main Doctrine (the preaching of the Croſs) to obſerve all things, whatſoever our Lord and Saviour commanded them, and hath delivered to us by them, to remember them in all things, in their word and doctrine, and ſo to keep the ordinances, as they have delivered them to us, to ſtand faſt in the grace of the Goſpel, by and into which we are called, and ſo to hold the traditions which they have in his name delivered to us, <hi>Matthew 18. 20. 1 Corinthians 11. 2. 2 Theſſalonians</hi> 2. 14, 15. Alwayes acknowledging as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Lord, the things ſo delivered by them, 1 <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> 14. 36, 37 By whom the preaching was fully made known, that all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might hear (2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 4. 17.) and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and incouragement of the word heard, come into his houſe and rejoyce with his people, that call on him in truth, and ſo to acknowledge him, to pray unto him, to remember him, and wait on him and wait on him in his houſe with his people, where his name is truly acknowledged, as opportunity is vouchſafed in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as by the Apoſtles in his name delivered, <hi>Romans 15. 9, 10, 11. 1 Timothy 2, 4, 8. Proverbs 9. 1, 5. Matthew 22. 4, 10. Luke</hi> 14. 17, 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100080:19"/>For they have delivered to us the commandements of the Lord: Both what to hear, <hi>Mark 2. 24. (viz.)</hi> That which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard, even from the beginning in the word of the truth of the Goſpel, as by them delivered, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2. 1. with <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 1, 3. &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 24, 27. 1 Cor. 15. 1, 3. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 12. to the end, with <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And alſo how to hear (<hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18.) For the trying of all things, in thoſe prophecyings which are not to be deſpiſed, but reſpected and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by us, as well, as alſo for the tryal of every doctrine, or ſpirit, that may come to us (<hi>viz.</hi>) ſo as retaining and holding faſt that which is good. Even the good word or doctrine of Chriſt, as already come in the fleſh; and ſo as having finiſhed the works the father gave him to do on the earth, and being received up into glory in that body prepared for him in our nature, in which he bore our ſins on the tree, as they have delivered the ſame unto us, cleaving to, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faſt that, as the Touch-ſtone and Rule of Tryal; compare that, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. with 1 <hi>Theſſalonians 5. 20, 21. 2 Timothy 1. 13, 14, &amp;c. 1 John</hi> 4. 1, 6.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in the ſame name, and ſo by the Lord Jeſus, they have given us full inſtructions and commandements, how we ought to walk in all our remembrances and acknowledgment of him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to him in his ordinances: (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. and 4. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And in any thing where they have not limitted, or circumſcribed us, to this or that thing, or form, we are not to fall under the judgment, or become ſubject to the ordinances of men, ſuch as touch not, taſte not, handle not, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. 16, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Yea they have inſtructed us how, and in what caſes, we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, for our helpfullneſs in the underſtanding and uſe of ordinances, as well as for example and admonition to us, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 10. 1, 18.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>In the manner of our ſeeking, remembring, and acknowledging him in his wayes; It is after the Due Order:</hi> Alwayes firſt, and chiefly, to mind the greater, or more weighty matters of the law, of the things declared in the Apoſtles doctrine, or inſtructed to thereby, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in precepts, and not to neglect the lighter matters (as they are called in compariſon of the greater, though there is nothing in Gods law, doctrine, or requirings, that is in it ſelf light) but to obſerve them according to the inſtruction of, and in ſubſerviency to the greater and more weighty, <hi>Matthew 23. 23. Luke 11. 42. Hoſea</hi> 6. 6. As</p>
            <p>1 The end of all ordinances is the greater thing in them, and more weighty then the circumſtances in the manner of obſervance, and ſo to be minded and preferred, as the Apoſtle ſignifies, both of the law, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo of the commandement of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100080:20"/>
everlaſting God in the Goſpel of Chriſt, and things inſtructed to therein, from the end of which commandement, he ſaith: Some having ſwerved, or not ayming at that, have turned aſide to vain jangling, deſiring to be teachers of the Law, and ſo urging precept upon precept, though without any certain ground, foundation, or rule of harmony, not knowing what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm. The great things of his law being ſtrange things to them, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. 12. with 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Now the great end of all ordinances, is to Preach, or witneſs not our ſelves to our ſelves, or to him, or to others; But Jeſus the Lord to teſtifie of him unto us, and ſo to hold forth and witneſs repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and remiſſion of ſins in his name, and for us to remember, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, wait upon, and ſeek unto him, (and not our ſelves) in them.</p>
            <p>Thus we read of <hi>Johns</hi> baptizing them with water, as well as his verbal preaching; That it was to manifeſt Chriſt to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not to manifeſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> to Chriſt, or to themſelves, or one another, but to manifeſt Chriſt to them as the Son of God, the Saviour of the World, <hi>John</hi> 1. 29, 31. And ſo all the people that heard, and the <hi>Publicans</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified (not themſelves but) God, owned, and acknowledged the truth of his teſtimony, and grace in Chriſt in being baptized with the baptiſm of <hi>John, Luke</hi> 7. 29.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe the Apoſtles baptizing the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with their word, or doctrine, and alſo with water in his name, it was in order to the diſcipling them unto Chriſt, and to that purpoſe to witneſs repentance and remiſſion of ſins in his name to them; not to witneſs themſelves repentance and remiſſion of ſins in them, or in their name, or any other for them: But in the name of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And ſo the Supper of the Lord, is a commemoration and ſhewing forth (not of our graces and excellencies, but) of the Lords death till he come, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 11. 23, 26. That we might therein acknowledge, remember, and be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and led into ſuch a diſcerning of the Lords body, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to examine and judge our ſelves (as we have hinted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place before.) So likewiſe all our prayers to him, and confeſſions of him are to this great end: That we and others might be led into and filled with the knowledge of him, that therein we may be ſtrengthned with all might in the inner-man; that Chriſt may dwell in our hearts by faith, that ſo we may be rooted and grounded in love, and filled with all goodneſs, and with all the fulneſs of God, through the knowledge and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100080:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faith of him. All his ordinances, as ordained, and delivered by him, teſtifie of him, and lead to him, and are given us that we might remember him in them, as in all his wayes.</p>
            <p>Now this being the end of all, we are therefore directed to Gods teſtimony concerning Chriſt, as to the viſion of all viſions, and foundation and key of knowledge unto all ordinances, for helping our underſtandings in, and directing to the right obſervance and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the things required in them.</p>
            <p>And therefore alſo for our underſtanding, who they are, that walk as they have the Apoſtles for an example, we are inſtructed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (not ſo much or firſtly, as a rule to know them by, the outward appearance in the zealous obſervance of this, or that circumſtance; but) the end of their converſation, which is Jeſus Chriſt. The ſame (even the mighty God and our Saviour) Yeſterday, and to day, and for ever. <hi>In what he hath done,</hi> and is become himſelf, in his own body for us, in which he is the Son of God, the Saviour of the World of man-kind without difference or reſpect of perſons, as all are in themſelves, and as from <hi>Adam</hi> in a like conſideration, wholly ſinful and miſerable by nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in what he is now doing, as the great and powerful Mediator,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men: In which he is the living God, the Saviour of all men, that through him they might believe and be ſaved. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Saviour of them, that through that grace to man-ward bringing ſalvation wherewith he prevents every man in due time, do believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in what he will do in his eternal judgment, at his ſecond and glorious appearing, and kingdome:</hi> In which he ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly appear; The mighty God and our Saviour; the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r to the utmoſt of all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, that through his love, love him, and wait for his appearing, they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Lord with an everlaſting ſalvation, and ſhall not be confounded World without end, when all that now are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt him ſhall be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Thus is Jeſus Chriſt in theſe three great things teſtified of him in the preaching of the Croſs, the ground and end of all ordinances, and ſo the end of the converſation that is ordered aright. The things principally minded and aimed at in all things, <hi>Phillipians 3. 17, 20, 21. Hebrews</hi> 13. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>2 There are alſo ſome ordinances that are more weighty then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even of thoſe that are of his appointment, for us to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and wait upon him in; yet ſome are to be chiefly preferred for our exerciſe, and earneſtly to be attended to and ſtriven for, to be kept without ſpot <hi>(viz)</hi> ſuch as more directly tend to the end of all,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100080:21"/>
and are more plainly diſcovering it, and leading to it, and are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as the more choice inſtruments, and means thereto; yea they are ſuch as include others, and in which the diſcovery of the ground and uſe of others is brought unto us, as the ordinance of baptizing with water, is included in the work or buſineſs of Preaching the Croſs of Chriſt, being an outward way or ſeal to be uſed for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing repentance and remiſſion of ſins in his name, for, and to them as verbally preached in the goſpel. And therfore alſo the ground, end, and uſe of that ordinance is diſcovered in the Doctrinal Preaching of the Croſs; whence alſo the Apoſtle prefers the Preaching of the Croſs, before that ordinance of baptizing with water, and was glad, he baptized no more himſelf, leaſt any ſhould ſay he baptized in his own name; and gives this as the reaſon, why he was ſo indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent how few he baptized with his own hands. For, ſaith he, Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel, that is not onely, nor ſo much to baptize; the main buſineſs that he was ſent eſpecially to look too, was the preaching of the Goſpel. Or thus; He was not otherwiſe ſent to baptize, then as that is a thing inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the work, or buſineſs of preaching the Goſpel as a lighter thing in the work or ſervice required of them to that purpoſe, and therefore alwayes ſo to be uſed as may be ſubſervient to the greater—For (ſaith he) The preaching of the Croſs (That as diſtinguiſhed from and in ſome ſenſe oppoſed to the other ordinance, as by it ſelf conſidered, as 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 21. The baptiſm that ſaveth anſwerably to the figure there alluded to, is not the putting away the filth of the fleſh (<hi>viz.</hi>) the outward baptiſm. But the anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, which ſtands in this, that Chriſt hath dyed; yea rather is riſen again, and is on the Right Hand of God, making interceſſion for us, and through him God juſtifieth the ungodly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with that of <hi>Peter, Romans</hi> 8. 32, 33, 34. with <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 5, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 25. and 5, 1, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9. 14, and 10. 19, 22. So here, not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with water, but the preaching of the Croſs) is to them that periſh fooliſhneſs, but to us that are ſaved its the power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14, 18.</p>
            <p>So alſo, there are other appointments for decency and order in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblings and obſervance of ordinances, as to ſay, men in praying or propheſying to have their head uncovered, and women to have a covering on the head, as likewiſe we find in the Scriptures plentiful directions to the uſe of reverend geſtures, as kneeling or ſtanding in prayer to God.</p>
            <p>Yet about theſe, or ſuch like things, the Apoſtle ſaith; We have no ſuch cuſtome, nor in any of the Churches, as from them, to be contentious, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 11. 1, 16. That in all things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100080:21"/>
and earneſtly ſtriven for, is onely the faith of the Goſpel, <hi>Jude 3. Phil. 1. 27. Gal.</hi> 2. 5. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and 9, <hi>in.</hi> and 10. 23, 23.</p>
            <p>So then to ſeek the Lord regularly, or after the due order, is in all our ſeeking chiefly to mind, and be exerciſed in the great things of Gods law, the things in which the Kingdome ſtandeth; yea even for our underſtanding and direction to the uſefulneſs of the lighter matters, as may be ſubſervient to the greater.</p>
            <p>They then ſought him not after the due order, that ſpent their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eal and laid the ſtreſs of their Religion, in multiplying Altars, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and Waſhings, yea in lighter matters, as Tything mint, Annis, Cummin, and regarded not, but neglected the great things of Gods law, as judgement, mercy, and ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>In lik manner were they irregular, in all their ſeeking and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, who refuſing Gods councel to run into his name in Chriſt, as witneſſed in the Law and Prophets as their reſt, and as the foundation and key of knowledge unto all precepts, did eſteem, and look upon the great things of his law, contained in that name witneſſed, as ſtrange things to the precepts for their worſhip, or as having no relation to them, or influence upon them: And ſo made the word of the Lord to themſelves, Precept upon Precept, Line upon Line, here a little and there a little, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>This love is to be the ſame and indifferent to them, as they are Chriſts in that peculiar ſence, without partiality or reſpect of perſons, as they are rich or poor, bond or free.

(Compare the fore-mentioned Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 27, 28.) Thoſe ſeeming helps may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to us much bodily exerciſe, and ſuch kinde of ſtudy as is a weariſomneſs to the fleſh; but the profit gained by them is but little, and for a little while.</p>
            <p>And if time were ſpared from ſuch diſcourſes and readings as in which chiefly the excellency of wiſdome and of words is ſhewed in declaring and for demonſtrating and making out the teſtimony of God, we might have more to ſpend better, and in more free and diligent attention to thoſe helps, that might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed helps and profitable to us.</p>
            <p>But how much more, are we to go from the preſence of ſuch ſooliſh men as have not the lip of knowledge, ſo ſoon as we perceive it, to ceaſe to hear the inſtruction that cauſeth to err from the words of knowledge; becauſe not onely they are in themſelves polluting, but alſo that with more diligence and earneſtneſs we may continue together in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and ſellowſhip ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel, that in nothing we may be terrified by our adverſaries.</p>

            <p>Surely a good and pleaſant thing is this unity of the Spirit, and the generation of ſeekers dwelling together in it: For there the Lord hath commanded the bleſſing, even life for evermore: Where ever two or three are gathered together in his name, there is he in the midſt of them, rendring them comely as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is compact together, and terrible as an Army with Banners, <hi>Pſam</hi> 103 <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20.</p>
            <p>This laſt branch of order in the manner of our ſeeking is fitly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the latter part of the former branch: <hi>For onely by Pride commeth Contention, Envying, and Strife; And then follows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and every evil work,</hi> Proverbs 13. 10.

            <p>And God hath ſo ſet the members in the Body, that the chief, ſtrongeſt, or moſt eminent, cannot ſay to the more feeble or inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our oves, I have no need of you, that there ſhould be no Sciſme in the Body, but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and that the whole body being fitly joyned and compact together from him, who is the head even Chriſt might by that which every joynt ſupplyeth according to the effectual working in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of every part, make increaſe unto the edifying of it ſelf in love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. 25. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 7. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>We ſhall here add a word or two by way of particular application to our ſelves, of what hath been hitherto ſpoken to this point.</p>
            <p>That the Lord hath made a ſad and very grievous breach upon us we have ſeen before, and now have taken a view of ſome of thoſe ways of iniquity, that are the procuring cauſes of ſuch judgements as they are expreſſed in this acknowledgement; <hi>For that we ſought him not after the due order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then ſearch and try our wayes, deſiring God to teach us what we ſee not, and make us willing to be ſenſible wherein we our ſelves have been, and are polluted with any of theſe wayes of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which indeed are ſuch crooked pathes, as in which who ſo walketh, ſhall know no peace.</p>
            <p>What I ſhall ſay in this application, I ſhall rank under theſe three heads.</p>
            <p>I Hath not ſuch folly and iniquity been found too generally with us? As when a price hath been put in our hands to get wiſdome, we have had no heart to prefer and prize it according to the nature and worth of it, to accept and improve it with earneſtneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the end for which it was put in our hands, even to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Lord to take away what we had, becauſe in having we had it not. And who can ſay, his heart is clean? How have we foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly preferred things of leaſt concernment? Yea, even for lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, the appearing beauty of which we have obſerved, and let our eyes fly upon, have we not even for them by ſuch obſerving them, neglected, deſpiſed, and forſaken our own mercies? Yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch as to whom, the ſpeaking of God by his Son, through the miniſtration of this, and other his ſervants, hath been as a pleaſant Song.</p>
            <p>Yet have not they, even while with their mouth they have ſhewed much love; let their heart run after their covetouſneſs, pleaſures, and other luſts: And even loved, and preferred the praiſe of men,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100080:30"/>
before the praiſe of God. Yea though Goſpel convictions have been many times on our ſpirits, yet how have we ſhunned the light? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our deeds were reproved by it, ſmothering the truth of God in unrighteouſneſs, choaking the ſaving effecacy of it in our hearts, with the deceitfulneſs of riches, the cares of this life, and the luſts of other things, till we have (it is to be feared) many of us hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our hearts to a hating inſtruction, deſpiſing, reproof, not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voice of our teachers, nor inclining our ear to them that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed us.</p>
            <p>Yea even to a ſecret murmuring and indignation againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they teſtified concerning us, that our works were evil, though they did it in bearing witneſs to his infinite grace in Chriſt, for, and towards us.</p>
            <p>It was one of the greateſt griefs, and burchens on the Spirit of this Servant of the Lord, much complained of by him, towards his end, That he had preached the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt in this place, till it was made a reproach and deriſion to him, till it was even ſnuffed at, and become contemptible, a burthen; yea a Savour of Death to them that ſometime had heard it with gladneſs, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in it.</p>
            <p>2 If we look farther, even upon the generality of thoſe that have a great zeal of God, and pretend to be earneſt ſeekers and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of him in theſe parts where this light ſhined, yea even among thoſe that were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light, as <hi>John</hi> 5. 33. 35.</p>
            <p>Yet how few <hi>ſeeking the Lord after the due order?</hi> But firſt ſeeking to frame their hearts unto, and do ſomething for God, that thence they may conclude, God hath a gracious affection towards, and hath done great things for them in Chriſt. Firſt ſeeking to know their love to him, that from thence they may conclude his love to them: Firſt ſeeking to know, or rather gueſs, or imagine their election, before they will know or believe Chriſts death for them, yea that they may gather the knowledge of that from the other. And being ſo funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally out of order, <hi>The Viſion of all,</hi> is become to them as a ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed book.</p>
            <p>The great things of his Law a ſtrange thing, having no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or perſwaſion of the truth of it, they can have no uſefulneſs of it, as to any of their worſhip, but their fear towards him is taught by the precepts of men, according to which they prefer, and lay the ſtreſs of their Religion, in the lighter matters, yea in the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men, ſuch as Tonch not, Taſte not, Handle not; neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weighty matters of the Law, as Judgement, Mercy, and Faith. Yea, how is the foundation and head of the corner laid aſide
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100080:30"/>
by the chief builders, and teachers that they heap up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
            <p>May not this complaint be taken up, of the generallity of thoſe that profeſs them ſelves the Churches of Chriſt, and are called by his name, and gathered into ſocieties, and pretended order: (Though it may be feared of the greateſt part of them, not by him, not entring by the door, but climbing up, or creeping in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way into ſuch houſes or ſocieties, as the Apoſtle fore-tells us, ſuch ſhall do in the latter dayes, as under a form of godlineſs privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny the power of it, the Groſs of Chriſt, the Lord that bought them. I ſay, may not this complaint be taken up of the generality of them.) That take away but their diſorder and irregularneſs, and what will be left them of all their Religions, or of all their fear, or worſhip towards God.</p>
            <p>Its to be feared of the greateſt part of them, very little, if any thing, their fear, or worſhip it ſelf, is little elſe, but a bundle of confuſion and diſorder, their very ſtock, is a Doctrine of vanity and lyes, their root, rottenneſs, and confuſion (at leaſt in a great part of it) and what then can be expected in any of the bloſſomes or branches, as ſpringing from ſuch a root, but diſorder and confuſion, like as in the Land of Darkneſs, where there is no order, and where their light is as darkneſs, as hath been oft bewailed by this ſervant of the Lord, concerning many of them among whom he formerly had his converſation. And with whom, and for whoſe good he ſtill la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured exceedingly, as he had opportunity, notwithſtanding the many diſcouragements he met with from them, but God hath taken him from the evil.</p>
            <p>3 If we go yet farther to take a view of the true worſhipers, or ſuch as in ſome meaſure call on him in truth, or at leaſt are more fundamentally in order then the former. Yet what diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion hath been found with them? Yea what pollution in their holy things, had they as they have been redeemed from among men, and gathered together unto him, by the powerfull effecacy of his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood diſcovered: Had they even ſo, in the light, and power of that grace cleaved together in his name, <hi>and ſought the Lord after the due order,</hi> they might have prevented this breach; yea had we yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the judgement was deviſed and framed againſt us, as a puniſhment and correction of our diſorder.</p>
            <p>Had we (I ſay) yet <hi>ſought him after the due order</hi> in this thing, and ſo for the healing and reſtoring to us this our now deceaſed Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. While yet there was hope, as the taking him away, was along time evidently enough threatned before finiſhed, to give us oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſeek him in due manner while he might have been found,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100080:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and intreated by us in that matter. If we would have judged our ſelves, ſurely we ſhould not thus have been judged; had we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in the opportunity (which is now paſt for that) prepared our ſelves to the ſearch and conſideration, what is the meaning of the voice in ſuch judgements threatned, and ſearched and tryed our wayes in the true glaſs, and with a true heart, that what is halting might be healed.</p>
            <p>And ſo run into his name together, to ſee what we might have ſought for with ſervency in ſuch a caſe as this, and on what ground, and in that inſtruction &amp; incouragement ſought it of him, or rather ſought him in it, (with a hearty acknowledgement of the evil of our ways and doings, humbling our ſelves under his mighty hand lifted up) That he would graciouſly teach us what we ſee not, and make us willing to ſee and be aſhamed of, &amp; give up what is diſcovered &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, that he would prepare our hearts and cauſe his ear to hear, that we might turn from our iniquities and underſtand his truth, and he might turn from the evil threatned, and not bring it upon us: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this judgement might have been prevented; God would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him of the evil, even when he had deviſed and prepared it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 8. 11. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30, 31.</p>
            <p>For this ſhall every one that is godly, every true worſhipper of God, that worſhip in ſpirit and truth; yea ſuch true worſhippers joyntly, and together ſtanding faſt in one Spirit, with one mind or ſoul, and ſo in perſonal fellowſhip one with another, as they have opportunity, they ſhall ſtrive together in their prayers in a time of finding, even for this, To prepare our hearts to him, that we may not ſtill hide our iniquity under our tongue, or ſet up the Idol of it in our hearts, but heartily acknowledge and confeſs it unto him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and reſign it up to him that is ready to pardon and heal: And to cauſe his ear to hear, That he may do for us for his Names<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, forgiving the iniquity of our ſin.</p>
            <p>Surely in the Floods of great Waters they ſhall not come nigh him, The Lord our God would graciouſly have hidden us from the reproach and ſhame of our iniquities, and compaſſed us about with ſongs of deliverance, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>For he meeteth them that rejoyce, and work righteouſneſs, and remember him in his wayes, in thoſe is continuance, and we ſhall be ſaved. But we are all as an unclean thing, and our righteouſneſs in ſo giving glory to him as therein taking ſhame to our ſelves, and hearty confeſſion of our ſins in the confeſſion of his name, and aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing righteouſneſs to him, is as filthy raggs; We all do fade as a leaf.</p>
            <p>If at any time there be any little ſence off and humbling under his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100080:31"/>
mighty hand when lifted up, our goodneſs as the morning dew ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſeth away, yea our iniquities like the Winde hath taken us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>And there is none that calleth upon his Name, or ſtirreth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take hold of him, as we are inſtructed, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 27. 5, 6. See <hi>chap.</hi> 64. 5 7.</p>
            <p>Is not this complaint verified among us (I ſpeak it with ſhame and grief, as my ſelf with my brethren falling under the reproof of it.) That in all our cryings and prayings to God, when this evil was already come upon us, in the ſentence of it, and when as yet the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the execution of it might have been prevented, yet we have not hitherto made our prayer unto God, that we might turn from our iniquities and underſtand his truth. Therefore hath the Lord watched for the evil and brought it upon us, for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doth, for we obeyed not his voice, <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 13, 14. And becauſe we did it not at the firſt, Therefore the Lord our God hath made this breach upon us.</p>
            <p>And this leads us unto the particular view of thoſe evils bewailed in the Text, unto which this acknowledgement is here applyed; <hi>We ſought him not after the due order:</hi> That is, they did not this at the firſt, unto which he had now inſtructed and counſelled them.

            </p>
            <p>The evils then for which God made this breach upon them were.</p>
            <p>1. That the Prieſts and Levites did not Sanctifie themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor keep their charge, as to bearing the Veſſels of the Lord.</p>

The Prieſt-hood is changed, ſince the riſing of the great High-Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> even the man Chriſt Jeſus through ſufferings glorified, in the ſame body in which he bore our ſins on the tree. For no man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſo alſo Chriſt glorified not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be made an High-Prieſt, But he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, To day have I begotten thee, he that prepared him a body, he that raiſed him from the Dead, now no more to return to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, even the ſame ſaid unto him, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi> Not after the law of a Carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but after the power of an endleſs life; For becauſe this man continueth ever, therefore he hath an unchangeable Prieſthood, therefore the Father hath made him in his own perſon, the Great, and everlaſting Apoſtle, and High-Prieſt of our profeſſion: And therefore alſo hath given unto him, all thoſe who through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Heavenly call, (with which he calleth all in due time) even through the diſcoveries and influences of that life in him, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing from him, and through him, by which the Father draweth to him, are therein drawn and choſen out of the World, unto obedience (the obedience of ſaith) and to the ſprinkling of the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe the Father hath given to him to be his houſe, an holy Prieſt-hood to him, and ſo in a ſenſe, or after ſome ſort they are partakers with him of his Heavenly calling, to miniſter to, and with him about the holy things of the true ſanctuary which the Lord pitched and not man, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices acceptable to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 18. 20. &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. 30.</p>

            <p>1. As to the perſons unto whom their miniſtry is to be extended, and among whom to be exerciſed. As their charge was to bear, and keep the veſſels of the Lord, and to miniſter about holy things, for, and in the behalf of the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, To whom was committed the Oracles of God, the knowledge of which as given by the Prophets, was by the Prieſts lips, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt and unto them, To whom alſo pertained the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Glory, the Covenants, the giving of the law, the ſervice of God, and the promiſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. and 9. 4.</p>
            <p>Even ſo now, The charge of the holy Prieſthood whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given unto Chriſt, to miniſter unto him, and keep his charge, who is the great Apoſtle, and High-Prieſt of our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is to bear the veſſels of the Lord, and to miniſter about holy

things, for, and in the behalfe of, unto, and amongſt all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Unto the Apoſtles eminently, this charge was committed, to go into all the World, to diſciple the Nations to Chriſt baptizing them in his name, preaching the Goſpel to every creature of all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſmall and great, <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> bond and free, witneſſing repentance and remiſſion of ſins to them, and amongſt them as in his name for them, and that in baptizing them (with their word, or doctrine, and alſo as an outward ſeal to that with water) in his name; and therein teaching them to obſerve as inſtructed, moved, and capacitated, by his preventing Grace through their word, all things that Chriſt had commanded them. To them was committed the grace of Apoſtleſhip for obedience to the faith among all Nations for his name.</p>
            <p>And unto all them that believe through their word, in a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary ſenſe is this charge committed, That they ſhould ſhine as lights in the World as they have capacity, and opportunity in their ſeveral places where they are ſet, to keep that commandement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, until the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; They ought not to account any man common, or unclean, or as left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that outward ſtate of uncleanneſs, which ſometime remained on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are now made nigh by the blood of Chriſt <hi>Act.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Servants therefore, as Servants (not as Lords or Worldly Princes by a worldly power, nor by the wrath of man) are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the gathering them together, as many as they finde, both good and bad, and the bringing them into his houſe, to rejoyce with his People, to eat of his Bread, and drink of the Wine that he hath mingled, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 9. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Matthew</hi> 22. 9, 10. <hi>Romans</hi> 15. 6. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As to the manner of their ſervice in the charge commited to them whereas the ſervice of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood, was exerciſed in the tipes and patters of Heavenly things; and ſo in offering ſuch gifts and ſacrifices, as could never make themſelves, and therefore not the comers perfect as pertaining to the Conſcience, but ſtood onely in meats and drinks, and divers waſhings, and tipical rights and ceremonies impoſed on them, till the time of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they had a Worldly or Earthly Sanctuary, and Veſſels of the Miniſtry committed to their charge: They had an earthly and tipical Ark, and mercy ſeat all patterns, and figures of the true, and in the Ark, the firſt Teſtament which made nothing perfect, but pointed to a better hope in Chriſt, and ſo were Miniſters of the letter, and had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100080:34"/>
a miniſtration of death, to nurture and lead to life, and peace in him that was to come.</p>
            <p>Now the ſervice of the holy Prieſthood is to be exerciſed in the Heavenly things themſelves. That which is committed to their charge, is, the revelation of Grace and Truth, as now come forth in, and by Jeſus Chriſt delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification. The diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, in which al things are gathered together in one, and ſo in which is the revelation of the truth, and body of all thoſe figures, tipes, and ſhadowes in the law, even in Chriſt, that excellent miniſtry, in which God hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings, whereas that committed to them, was but Gods ſpeaking in divers parts. In this ſpeaking by his Son laſt of all, is given unto us, the full and clear revelation of the name of the Father, in the manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtation of the truth of all his former Oracles and promiſes to the Fathers, and ſo of his infinite grace and glory therein, and that in the face of Chriſt, in the diſcovery of which his name, The name of the Son is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, in which he is manifeſted, as before witneſſed, in Oracles, Tipes, and Propheſies, and as the fulfilling, and body of them all, in what he hath already done, and by means thereof doth, and will do. The Son of God, the Saviour of the World. The Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the World, the perfect ſacrifice and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for ſin, That is, the onely and compleat ranſome and price of redemption for all. The Mediatour between God and men, the High-Prieſt over the houſe of God, yea the onely He, in whom it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Father, that all fulneſs ſhould dwell, even the fulneſs of the God-head bodily, and in whoſe blood the whole New Teſtament of precious promiſes, both for this life, and that to come is ſealed, that alſo the performance of them may be given forth in due time with him.</p>
            <p>And this revelation of the Son, and ſo of the Father in him, is given us in the full evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit, with plainneſs and power, in which alſo the name of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, is revealed in his full and glorious teſtimony of Chriſt, and ſo of the Father in him immediately given, and in his powerful preſence, and working with it unto all things pertaining to life and godlineſs to the end of the World, as was before prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of that powring forth of him from on high.</p>
            <p>And ſo they are Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but of the Spirit; being in this diſpenſation bleſſed with all Spiritual Bleſſings, and that not in earthly or tipical, but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, even in Chriſt, in whom all Spiritual bleſſings, the truth and body of all figures and tipes are treaſured up for us, and in

the rveelation of him brought to us, and in this Miniſtry committed to the Holy Prieſthood, That they ſhould offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices of prayer and praiſe to God continually, and confeſſion of his name by Jeſus Chriſt, as comed in the fleſh, and ſo that they ſhould Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the Heavenly things themſelves, and not in Tipes, Figures, or Patterns, as the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood, but in, and about the true Sanctuary, Mercy-Seat, Altar, Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the truth and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of all, is met and found in him.</p>
            <p>So then, the bearing, and keeping the charge of the Veſſels of the Lord, that is now, the work, or ſervice of the Holy Prieſthood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, and was reſembled by the Prieſts, and Levites bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and keeping the charge of the Ark, of the Sanctuary, and of all the Veſſels of the Miniſtry; may be thus expreſſed.</p>
            <p>1. Their great buſineſs, and the ſum of all, is to keep and to bear, even to bear upon them, and hold forth. The truth of God, as it is now come forth and manifeſted in the perſonal body of Jeſus Chriſt, which the Father prepared for him in our nature, that he might do his will for us, and in which he bore our ſins on the Tree, and in which being raiſed from the dead, he is entred into his glory for us, which is ſuch, as in which it hath pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell in him, even the fulneſs of the God-head bodily, That by him our faith and hope might be in God. They are to hold faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hold forth to others, this acknowledgement or profeſſion of their faith, in which thoſe things, which the Prophets ſaid ſhould come to paſs, That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and that he ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſhould ſhew light to the People, and to the Gentiles, is declared to be even ſo fulfilled, and come forth in that one offering of his perſonal body once for all. And ſo in him the truth, and body of all the tipes and ſhadowes of the law.</p>
            <p>Whence the houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God, as now it is ſince the appearing of Chriſt, the Church of the man Chriſt raiſed from the dead, who was dead, but is alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and ſtandeth in the name and majeſty of God his Father to feed, and rule.</p>
            <p>I ſay his ſpiritual houſe, his holy Prieſthood, is (according to the general acception of that, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. 15.) ſaid to be, The Pillar and ground of truth, even of the manifeſtation of the truth, and righteouſneſs of God in all his former Oracles, and promiſes given to the Fathers, and in all the grace and good things tipified, and witneſſed in the law and Prophets, as now come forth in Chriſt raiſed from the Dead, and treaſured up in his perſonal body for us.</p>
            <p>And though that Scripture may have another acception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100080:35"/>
in which that clauſe, the pillar and ground of truth, is attributed to the living God that ſtands before it, and indeed He, even God in Chriſt, and ſo the man Chriſt Jeſus in the name and majeſty of God, he is not onely the truth but in the moſt full and abſolute ſenſe, the pillar and ground of it, yet that underſtanding, though taken in here, deſtroyes not the ſence fore-mentioned, in which alſo His Church from him, and as in conjunction with him, the Head is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to be in a ſubordinate ſenſe the pillar and ground of truth: And happily the words may be ſo left, that we may take in the ſenſe of both acceptions together.</p>
            <p>We ſhall briefly ſpeak to it in the ſence we have mentioned, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the uſual acceptation, as that alſo may ſtand and agree with the other.</p>

               <hi>The truth of which in any ſence, The Church of the living God, is the Pillar and Ground, is (as before hinted) Jeſus Chriſt himſelf as raiſed from the Dead in that Body in which he was delivered for our offences.

To be put to that charge, and hard ſervice is proper to the makers, and worſhippers Idols, the imagined Deities, and Rocks of mens chuſing, which indeed are no Gods, but vanity and lyes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot bear up, ſupport, or ſave them that look to the, nor can they ſtand by themſelves; but muſt be born up, and maintained by them that make and worſhip them.

            <p>1. There is a previous Sanctification, neceſſary to fit them to this ſervice anſwering tô that ſeparation and conſecration of themſelves to the Lord, which was in that whole Tribe of <hi>Levy,</hi> gathering themſelves unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> to obey the word of the Lord and keep his covenant, in which he ſaid unto his Father and Mother, I have not ſeen them, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children, of which we read, <hi>Exodus</hi> 32. 26. 29. <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 33. 9.

            <p>As likewiſe anſwering to that ſeparating, or ſetting them apart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and for his peculiar uſe and ſervice, in which the Lord ſeparated that whole Tribe from the reſt of their hrethren, and took them to himſelf, as a devoted thing, inſtead of all the firſt-born of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his, and to draw near to him, to bear the Ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and to miniſter unto him, and to bleſs in his name, of which we read, <hi>Numbers</hi> 1. 49, 50. and 3. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>chap.</hi> 4. and 18. 2. 6. with <hi>chap.</hi> 19. 9, 10. <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 10. 8.</p>
            <p>It is ſuch as alſo anſwers to that tipical Sanctification, and in the fleſh by tipical waſhings, ſacrifices, and anointings, wherewith <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and his Sons were ſanctified, and conſecrated from the reſt of their brethren unto the Prieſts office. Of which we read <hi>Exodus</hi> 28. and 29. with <hi>Leviticus</hi> 8. <hi>tot.</hi> And that alſo with which the whole Tribe of <hi>Levy</hi> were ſanctified, and conſecrated from the reſt of the children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Of which we read <hi>Numbers</hi> 8. 5, 6. 22.</p>
            <p>The ſanctification of and in the truth anſwerably neceſſary to go before, to conſecrate and fit perſons to this miniſtry in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the truth is the ſame by or through which they are made of his Spiritual Houſe, and Holy Piieſt-hood, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 4,

            <p>1. As to the meanes by which it is effected. Its the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 2.

            <p>As the ſame being now infinitely, and immeaſurably given to, put, and cauſed to reſt upon him in that ſpotleſs body in which he bore our ſins on the Tree, is now by him poured forth from on high, in and with the Teſtimony of himfelf, the man Chriſt Jeſus, as through ſufferings entered into his glory, the office of which Spirit as ſo ſent forth is to bear witneſs of the truth in Chriſt Jeſus, even of the true water, or waſhing of regeneration, cleanſing and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the true blood of ſprinkling, with which through faith in it, the heart may be ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and the whole man in all his powers, motions, and actings waſhed; and ſo perſons purified a peculiar people to him zealous of good works: See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. 14. and 10. 19. 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. 4, 5, 6. It is ſuch a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaion and conſecration, as is effected through the righteouſneſs of God our Saviour, as now come forth and manifeſted in Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified as already evidenced by the ſpirit with which he is anointed in the ſame body, in which he bore our ſins on the Tree, and ſo brought to light through the Goſpel, his arme to ſave and ſanctifie. In and through which glorious Goſpel the holy Spirit takes of the things of Chriſt, the things that he hath done and finiſhed in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the earth, and the things by vertue thereof treaſured up in the ſame body for us in the name of the Father, and in ſhewing them glorifies him, renders him precious, comely and excellent, for the compleat ſanctifying us, and making us perfect to every good word and work; therein ſhewing him to be that perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat righteouſneſs, in which we being found through faith in it, ſhall be made acceptable to God, and meet to ſtand before him, to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Chriſt, and ſo ſhall be profitable to men, being filled and cloathed with the fruites of that righteouſneſs to the praiſe of his grace. And ſo the fountain of that Water of Gods grace and Spirit, and ſo the teſtimony of him that anointing, by the pouring out and ſhedding abroad of which we in receiving and attending to it, ſhall be waſhed, inlightened, healed, ſtrengthned, and made meet for ſervice. Yea that one offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by which all our Sacrifices, brought and offered by him, ſhall be made acceptable and to his praiſe.</p>

            <p>2. As to the nature of the work, or effecacy of this one Spirit through the Goſpel on the ſubject, needfull to go before to make meet for this ſervice and inheritance of the Saints. It is ſuch, as in which through the righteouſneſs of God our Saviour, they are made partakers of like precious faith, with the Apoſtles, through this ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Spirit fore-mentioned, they are choſen out of the way and condition of the World, (that lyes in ignorance of God, in Chriſt, and enmity to him, and ſo under the power of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one) unto obedience the obedience of faith, ſo to underſtand and know him that is true, that therein the ſoul is brought into him, and united with him by faith, 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. 2. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 1. with 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19, 20. They are begotten by the word of truth, to ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feined belief of the truth, as now come forth in Chriſt, as in which its believed and received, not in vain but to purpoſe, even to the ſame purpoſe, to which it is diſcovered and given to them (<hi>viz</hi>) to the ſaving of the ſoul, bringing it out of the World, and worldly wayes of ſeeking reſt, righteouſneſs, wiſdome, ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into Chriſt for all; ſuch as in which they are redeemed from among men, and from their vain converſation received by tradition from them, and ſo waſhed in the Spirit of their minde from the errours and pollutions of the World, in which men are vainly ſeeking reſt, peace, wiſdome, righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where it is not; unto God in Chriſt to ſeek all in him by an exerciſe of faith in him in what he hath done, and is become for them in his own body, and in the hope ſet before them in him. Such it is, as in which their minds or ſouls are purified to unſeigned love, of God, of Men, &amp; brethren, in obeying the truth. They are principled with thoſe principles of truth, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lead ſo to truſt in him, and ſeek all in him, and ſo to love, that they may thenceforth walk in that newneſs of life. They are ſo baptized into Chriſt, euen into his death, that as to the Spirit of their minde, they are ſubdued and made willing to put on Chriſt for all, and be devoted to him; and to that purpoſe for the excellency of the knowledge of him, to let go all other excellencies as loſs, and dung, that they may win him, and be found in him, yea herein to hate Father, Mother, Brethren, Siſters, Wife, and Children; yea

And therefore alſo admoniſh and engage to what follows, namely in this calling to mind the day in which we were illuminated, and remembering how we have heard from the beginning, (as <hi>Hebr. 10. 32. 1 Joh. 2. 24. 27.

            <p>We find it many times very hard and difficult to recover our ſelves out of the ſnares of Satan, when we have willingly ſuffered our ſelves to be entangled in them after knowledge of the truth received, and ſo to recover out of relapſes, when we have back-ſliden from him that called us into the grace of Chriſt, to ſeek to perfect our peace, hope, joy, confidence, or ſanctification, according to the wiſedom or deſire of the fleſh, and ſo procured a loſſe of our firſt love, and decay of his work, or the powerfull efficacy and uſefullneſſe of his grace in us. And ſurely its more hard than to keep our ſelves in it when we are in it, yet the preaching of the Croſſe is the power of God to ſave in both ſenſes, to preſerve and to deliver, even to ſeek and to ſave them that are loſt, and have wandered and gone aſtray l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And to this we ſhall firſt briefly propound ſome conſiderations of their order.</p>
            <p>1. The whole Tribe of <hi>Levy,</hi> were ſeparated to beare the Arke of the Convenant of the Lord, and the veſſels of the Miniſtry, and to keep the whole charge of the Tabernacle of the congregation, to Miniſter unto the Lord, to ſing praiſe on outward inſtruments, and to bleſſe in his name, as was ſhewed before, <hi>Num.</hi> 1. and 3. and 8. 9-22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.

            <p>So while the Ark of the Lord, Alter, and veſſels of the Miniſtry were under curtains in a Tabernacle, moving from place to place, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo moved. The Prieſts, and Levites had their ſeverall charges and ſet offices, as to the keeping, and bearing the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100080:44"/>
veſſels of the Lord, and Miniſtring about holy things, as to give ſome inſtances. The Levites, the Sons of <hi>Kohath,</hi> were to take the charge of, and beare the Ark, the Table of ſhew bread, the Candle-ſtick, and Golden Altar, with the veſſels pertaining to them, as taken downe, put together and covered by the Prieſts, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 4-15.</p>
            <p>But to the office of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt partained the oyle for the light the ſweet incenſe, the dayly meate offering, and the anoynting oyle, and overſight of all the Tabernacle, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Sons of <hi>Gerſhim</hi> were appointed to beare the ſeverall hangings and coverings of Badgers skins, &amp;c. As the Prieſts ſhould appoint them their charge in all their burthens. To the Sons of <hi>Merary</hi> in like manner pertained, the Boards, Bars, Pillars, Sockets, Pins, &amp;c. And in ſtead of theſe ſervices, when <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Arke, and Tabernacle of the Lord had reſt. They had alſo their divers ſeverall ſet offices, ordayned by <hi>Samuell, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> according to the word of the Lord by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Severall choſen to be Porters in the Gates who were reckoned by their genealogy, and had the over-ſight of the Gates of the Houſe of the Lord by wards, and certain of them had the charge of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering Veſſels, that they ſhould bring them in and out by tale, ſome of them alſo to overſee the Veſſels and the fine Flower, the Wine, the Oyle, the Spices, &amp;c. but to the Sons of the Preiſts ſtill it pertained to make the oyntment of the Spices.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſome had their ſet office over the things made in the pans, others of the <hi>Kohathites</hi> were over the Shew-Bread, to prepare it every Sabbath. And they had alſo their ſeverall ſet offices and courſes of ſinging, praiſing, and bleſſing, in his name, the Preiſts with Trumpets, the Levites with other Inſtruments, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 25, 26. each to wait on their office according to their order, ſee, 1 <hi>Chron. 6. 31, 32. ch.</hi> 9. 10. to the end. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. &amp; 30. &amp; 31. with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 24. to the end. with <hi>chapters. 24. &amp; 25. &amp; 26. totall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 There were ſome appointed chief heads, who were of the chief of the houſe of their Fathers that had the overſight of theſe ſeverall offices and imployments, who had themſelves alſo ſome ſpeciall ſervice in them, and were to look to the management of the reſt, as appeares in the verſes before the text.</p>
            <p>There were ſome chief of the houſe of their Fathers to overſee the whole charge and ſervice of bearing the Ark and Veſſels of the Lord, &amp;c. So alſo we read of four chief Porters that had their ſet office, and the overſight of the whole charge upon them, who were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lodged round about the houſe, as more devoted to the looking
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100080:45"/>
to, and management of thoſe affaires. Likewiſe we read of chief heads of their Fathers appointed to be ſingers, and of ſeverall orders and courſes of firſt and ſecond degrees appointed by them, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 33 &amp;c. and 9. 33, 34. &amp;c. and 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. &amp;c. ſee alſo, <hi>Chapters</hi> 24. &amp; 25. &amp; 26.</p>
            <p>3 The Preiſts, the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and eſpecially the High-Preiſt had the whole charge and over-fight of the whole Tribe of Levie, and of their ſeverall offices and ſervice about the Houſe of God, and holy things, when the Tabernacle with the Ark and Veſſels of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery were to be carried from place to place. They were to appoint the ſeverall ſervices and burdens to the Levites, and to cover the holy things committed to the Kohathites charge, nor might the Kohathites look into, touch, or alter them leaſt they dye, and ſo to appoint and order all the other ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</p>
            <p>And when they had reſt, ſtill they were to appoint, order, and overſee the management of the whole buſineſſe, according to the Word of the Lord by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And to offer up and conſecrate the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites to their ſervice, and to offer the Burnt Offerings and the Bread of their God, to make and keep the charge of the Oyle for the Lights, and the Oyntments of Spices for anointing, &amp;c. As in the ſeverall Scriptures fore-mentioned may be ſeen, and none of the Levites, no not the heads or the chiefe of the heads of them, to preſume to doe any thing otherwiſe, then according to, and ſo as under their order. For they the whole Tribe, as they were devoted to the Lord, ſo were given as a gift to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his Sons, to miniſter unto them as in the fore-cited Scriptures may be ſeen.</p>
            <p>Anſwerable to this their tipicall order. There is an order to be obſerved by the holy Prieſthood now in the ſervice of the true Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and Sanctuary, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man, And in their bearing the veſſels of the Lord, and Miniſtration about holy things in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As.</p>
            <p>1 The whle company of them that call on him in truth, being ſo ſanctifyed by God the Father, and preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt are therein prepared, and made meete for this inheritance, and called to this ſervice, to ſtrive together for the faith of the Goſpell, to ſtand before him, as an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpirituall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and to ſhine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life (as hath beene ſhewed before) but each according to their ſeverall Abillities, and Capacities by the grace given, and gracious gifts beſtowed, and diſtributed to every man, yet with this cautionary proviſoe the women are not permitted to ſpeak in every place, not in the publick or generall aſſemblies of the Church, where there are,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100080:45"/>
or may be not onely many daughters and attenders, who are in ſome degree of ſimplicity waighting, though yet they have received little, But alſo many faighned as well as many halting believers, and likewiſe many ignorant and ſome wilfull oppoſers comming in among them.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſeemly for them in any aſſemblys of believers, ſo to ſpeak or act, as to uſurp authority over the man, and ſo not otherwiſe then ſo as they may be therein under obedience, as that (1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 14. 34.) without the Tranſlators addition is, thus read. It is not (or hath not been) permitted unto them to ſpeak, but to be under obedience, &amp;c. in which ſaying, as ſo read, are two parts in ſuch conjunction, and the former ſo depending on the latter, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand without it, and ſo this appears in the ſumme and ſcope of the ſaying; That it is not permitted to them otherwiſe to ſpeak then ſo as they be therein under obedience, for ſo we find the like phraſe or manner of ſpeech in other Scriptures and in other caſes carrying a like ſenſe, as <hi>John 5. 22. The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son.</hi> Now that the Father doth now judge men, and that without reſpect of perſons, is plainly expreſſed in other Scriptures, 1 <hi>Peter 1. 17. John</hi> 12. 48. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt part of that ſaying cannot ſtand alone or without the ſecond, yea our Saviour ſaith, in that ſame Chapter, <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. that <hi>The Son can do nothing of himſelfe but what he ſeeth the Father do.</hi> So that the ſenſe of the ſaying fore-mentioned appears to be this, That the Father judgeth no man immediatly, or otherwiſe then ſo as by committing all judgement to the Son, and ſo judging and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting judgement by him, like to which is that, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. <hi>Ye need not that any man teach you but as the ſame anointing teacheth, &amp;c.</hi> Now that they all needed the helpfulneſſe and teaching of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members and brethren, and that all believers do ſo while they are here in this preſent world, is evident enough in the ſame Chapter, <hi>verſes</hi> 1. 12. 15-24. 28. and in other Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. <hi>&amp;c. Epheſ. 7. 12, 13. &amp;c.</hi> But the ſenſe is clear, they need not that any man teach them but as that teacheth, or otherwiſe then as that teacheth, they need not any mans teaching that teacheth otherwiſe, as 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 6. 3. 5.</p>
            <p>So here, it is not permitted into the Women to ſpeak, but to be under obedience, that the firſt part of this cannot ſtand alone, or without the ſecond, is evident in the Scripture, for they, eſpecially the elder wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are exhorted, and inſtructed ſo to ſpeak, as to be teachers of good things, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 3, 4. yea women are commended for labouring with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Goſpell, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3. and that a woman expounded unto
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100080:46"/>
               <hi>Apollo.</hi> The way of the Lord more perfectly we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 26. yea that they were of the firſt witneſſes and preachers of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, the Evangeliſts tell us; and that they may, as any of them is through grace ſitted thereto, both pray and prophecy, and that in the preſence of others, in ſome aſſemblys of believers is clearly fignified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5. and in other Scriptures; but the ſenſe of the ſaying in both parts together is this; They ought not, nor is it ſeemly for them otherwiſe to ſpeak either in praying or prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the mouth of others, or in propounding queſtions, nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to act, no not in the Church, or any the aſſemblys thereof, then ſo as therein they be under obedience, and in quiet ſilence and ſubjection to the man ſo as in the Lord, and therein to the wiſe and holy order and diſpoſition of God. They then are not capable of any office of rule or overſight in the Church as Elders and Deacons, but to be in ſubjection.</p>
            <p>Yea farther I ſuppoſe: That in any aſſemblys of believers where there are men in preſence, fitted for ſpeaking in prayer, or prophecy, or in propounding and anſwering queſtions for the edification of others, it may be convenient for the women there to be ſilent, yea a ſhame for them to ſpeak, unleſſe in ſome extraordinary caſes, or on ſome particular occaſione, and ſo as deſired or appointed, as to the order and time of ſuch their ſpeaking by ſuch brethren in preſence with them, or that are alſo over them in the word of the Lord, as they may judge it needfull and convenient; for the man was firſt formed then the woman, likewiſe the woman was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, nevertheleſſe, neither is the man without the woman, nor the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without the man in the Lord. But I forbear to urge my apprehenſions of theſe things, and leave what is ſaid to correction by better judgement.</p>
            <p>The women then for decency and orderſake obſerving ſuch cautions, as 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 33, 34, 35. 1 Timothy</hi> 2. 11, 12. &amp;c. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5—10. and ſo every one, man or woman, keeping their place, and attending that place and ſervice to which they are ſitted and called: The whole Church of unfeigned believers may all prophecy one by one, as God hath dealt to them ſuch a gift, or exerciſe any other gift they have, according to their ſeverall abillity in this ſhift for the faith of the Goſpell, that all may learn, and all may be comforted according as God hath dealt to every man.</p>
            <p>For as there are many members in one body, and all members have not the ſame office, ſo we being many are one body in Chriſt, and every one members one of another, to every one of us
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100080:46"/>
is given grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt; he who hath ſet the members in the body as it hath pleaſed him, divides to every man ſeverally as he will, for there are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame ſpirit and differences of adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord and diverfities of operations, but it's the ſame God which worketh all in all, but the manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every one to profit withall according to his meaſure, for to one is given by the Spirit the word of wiſedom, to another knowledge by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to another faith, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And ſo theſe ſeverall gifts were ſet in the Church, Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Teachers, rancked under five heads, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. there were alſo other gifts added with theſe to the Church, to accompany the firſt proclamation of the Goſpell to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the firſt witneſſes, which gifts were not ſo ſet for continuance as the former unto which they were added, and therefore not mentioned among thoſe which were given to continue in the Church, till it come to its perfect ſtate, compare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtles themſelves as they were appointed and choſen to peculiar ſervice, that by them the preaching might be fully known, and that all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might hear, ſo they were not onely immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Lord, but alſo peculiarly gifted with all ſpirituall gifts to fit them to that ſervice, they had all the ſcriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſo opened to them, and their underſtandings ſo opened and ſtrengthened to underſtand them, and the revelation of the myſtery even of the truth of all, as fulfilled, come forth and manifeſted in Chriſt, raiſed from the dead, ſo immediately and fully given them from the Lord himſelfe, and were ſo gifted with all wiſedom, knowledge, and utterance, that they was therein perfectly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and therefore ſent in his name to make known the myſtery as now revealed, and to make it known out of the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the commandment of the everlaſting God for the obedience of the faith among all Nations for his name, and ſo as wiſe Maſter-Builders, to lay the foundation for others to the end of the world to build on, and ſo their gift as it was peculiar to them, is yet left us in the fruit of it, in their word and doctrine confirmed and ſet in the Church.</p>
            <p>And ſo alſo their gift, even the gift of Apoſtles in a ſecondary and inferiour ſenſe is ſtill found in the prime degree of the gift of Prophecy as ſet in the Church, which therefore is mentioned as the head or chief of the beſt gifts, now to be coveted by believers, by other believers ſince, or beſides the Apoſtles, ſuch as believe through their word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31. with <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

or diverſity of meaſure, and ſo of adminiſtrations, and operations accordingly. Whence it is expreſſed in that to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> under theſe two heads. Prophets, Evangeliſts. The prime degree hath in it, ſuch an underſtanding of the Scriptures of the Prophets, even as the Teſtimony of Chriſt witneſſed by them as now manifeſted by the Apoſtles, is confirmed in the heart. As alſo ſuch acquaintance with the Scriptures, and ſuch skill in the word of righteouſneſſe. (<hi>vide.</hi>) The viſion of all, the great things of the Law, or doctrine delivered by the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and as the foundation of, and key of knowledge for opening all other things (namely the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus) as in which they are furniſhed, and apted to a plain, and cleare opening the foundation, as laid by the Apoſtles, and that out of the Scriptures of the Prophets, by the revelation of the miſtery given by the Apoſtles. And ſo to ſhew the things of Chriſt by the Scrriptures even the things already done in his owne body which the Prophets ſaid ſhould come to paſſe, and the powerfull efficacy of them with the Father for men, and in the name of the Father unto then. Through his powerfull mediation betweene God and men; as alſo therein to ſhew the things yet to come in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing, and Kingdome, and with this word of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo diſtinctly, and convincingly, to inſtruct, teach, exhort, reprove, &amp;c. By the Scriptures of the Prophets, as opened by the Apoſtles, that they are therein mighty through God, to the opening the eyes of the blind, convincing the ignorant, and gainſayers of the vanity and falſeneſſe of other foundations, in the plaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this, in the evidence, and demonſtration of the ſpirit with power, and to the helping them much, who through grace believe, <hi>Acts 18. 24, 25, 27, 28. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 1, 3, 4, 20, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>There is alſo an inferiour degree of this gift of prophecy (called in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. Evangelizing, included in Prephets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28.) In which (though there may be wanting, ſome of that abillity, and skill forementioned) yet there is ſo much of that nature, as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feete beautifull, to the alluting, and drawing to Chriſt eſpecially on the barren Mountaines, where men are not ſo ſetled on other objects, or where they are in any meaſure taken off from finding content, reſt, and feeding in them.</p>
            <p>Yea they that have not this gift, that are much wanting, and ſhort, in ſuch underſtanding, and acquaintance with the Scriptures, and ſuch skill in the word of righteouſneſſe, the great things of his Law contained in them, as might apt them ſo to open the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100080:47"/>
things to come; and thence, and therewith to inſtruct, &amp;c. as before. Yet they may have ſome word of knowledge, or of faith; ſome feeding or teaching gift, in which they may be fellow helpers to the truth by confeſſing his name, as they have proved the goodneſſe, and truth of it and may be helped to expreſſe it by the Scriptures, though not ſo to open, interpret, and give the ſence of the Scriptures, and ſhew the ſcope of them, and inſtructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, as others, that have a more excellent gift that way.</p>
            <p>Each might be profitable to themſelves, and others; to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and the world, and comely, and uſefull in their generation were they content to keep their place, and ſo to miniſter, as they have received the gift, and as God hath diſtributed to every one. Every one might have joy, and praiſe from God, in a right exerciſe of his owne gift that God hath given him, if he were not ſeeking, to have the rejoycing uſe, and praiſe of anothers gift, which yet is not his owne, which indeed ſprings from a deſire of vaine glory, whence thoſe admonitions, <hi>Rom. 12. 3. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. with ſuch vehemency urged.</p>
            <p>2. There are ſome appointed of God to goe before others, as guides, rulers, elders, or leaders in the Word of the Lord; to whom is eſpecially committed the peculiar ſervice, of Preaching the Croſſe of Chriſt of witneſſing repentance, and remiſſion of ſins in his name, and ſo of ſhewing Jeſus Chriſt, and the things of him, out of the Scriptures of the Prophets, and Apoſtles compared. And therewith interpreting, and opening the Scriptures, giving the ſence of the manifold, inſtructions, judgements, encouragements, reproofes, exhortations, &amp;c. Contained therein, and contending with oppoſers; to them alſo is more peculiarly committed, the whole charge of ordering, and managing the affaires of the Goſpell in the Church, and to the world-ward according to their capacity, and opportunity in the ſeverall places where they are ſet. And theſe according to the inſtructions of the Apoſtles given by the one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard, with the advice, prayers, and help of their brethren in the faith, as they may enjoy it, are to commit to others their ſeverall charges, according to their fitneſſe in firſt, and ſecond degrees.</p>
            <p>They are to commit the chiefe worke of preaching, and giving the ſence of the Scriptures, and ſhewing the things of Chriſt out of them, and contending with adverſaryes for the faith, unto faithfull men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo. Seeing to them, as they have opportunity that they teach no other doctrine, inſtructing, helping, and going before them in their Miniſtry, and ſeeking in a Goſpell way, to ſtop the mouths of unruly, and vain talkers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:100080:48"/>And to others that are faithfull, though not ſo able, nor gifted for the forementioned ſervices, as there is occaſion, and need, they may commit, the adminiſtration of the outward ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeing in his Name, which is mentioned by the Apoſtle, as a lighter matter of the Law, and not ſo peculiarly appropriated to choice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, (as alſo we have ſhewed before, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14-17.) which likewiſe is ſignified in our Saviours committing that to his diſciples before ſo ſit to be ſent forth to preach, <hi>John</hi> 4. 2.

            <p>Now let us here alſo ſearch and try our wayes, and be willing to ſee and acknowledge our confuſion and diſorder, as in theſe inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it may be diſcovered, and turn unto the Lord that hath ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itten us, with whom yet there is mercy and healing for us. And for a little farther particular application of theſe laſt inſtructions, to ſuch as are in any meaſure made of his ſpirituall houſe and holy Preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I ſhall briefly add a word or two unto ſuch; and oh that we were willing every one of us ſeriouſly to examine and judge our ſelves, and to know every man the plague of his own heart.</p>
            <p>Have we conſidered the nature and weight of the charge committed to us? and been willing or had our hearts prepared to ſeek it? to be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100080:51"/>
ſanctified to that ſervice after the ſanctification of his ſanctuary. Have we not defiled our ſelves with Idols, and with many polutions of fleſh and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Yea even then, when under pretence of having no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works, or workers of darkneſſe, we in our raſh zeale have been ſeeking to hinder and keep out others for their weakneſſe, ignorance, or ſinfulneſſe out of the houſe of God, and from rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and ſeeking the Lord with his people in his ordinances, and bidding them ſtand aloofe from us, we are holier then you, yet have we not? Inſtead of awakening, riſing, and ſtanding up from them in their ignorant and unclean principles and practices, which we ſhould have done and not the other; I ſay while inſtead of that, we have bidden them ſtand aloofe from us, I am holyer, &amp;c. Have we not walked in their wayes? and ſo had fellowſhip with them in their uncleanneſſes, in their covetouſneſſe, pride, following after the vanity of the mind, in the faſhions and cuſtoms of this world, and according to our former luſts in our ignorance, and after the Iuſts of men. Have we not ſought after, and doted on the wiſedom of this world, the praiſe of men and like things? nay do we not even out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip many of the world in theſe things, and teach the ignorant and wicked ones theſe our wayes? (while under pretence of holineſſe we will not let them learne better of us) and ſo ſtrengthen the hands of evill doers by our example, that none of them returnes by means of us from the evill of his way.</p>
            <p>Yea, how little dwelling together with all lowlineſſe of mind in the unity of the ſpirit? or ſubmitting of the younger to the elder, and all of us one to another in the feare of the Lord, as being cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with humility is there not rather a ſpirit of pride, and thence of diviſion, yea of madneſſe and giddyneſſe poſſeſſing us, that is ever ruſhing us into extreames. As to ſay.</p>
            <p>1. The younger, and ſuch as are taught in the word, as <hi>Gall.</hi> 6. 6. And alſo fellow-helpers to the truth, or ſuch as might be ſo more then they are, were they willing to walke circumſpectly, and with a right foot in the Goſpell. But ſuch of us. Are we not either headily ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or diſpiſing all helps of our brethren, or at leaſt ſuch as we might enjoy, and have much mercy in, and advantage by, as if we could underſtand the mind of God in the Scriptures, as well without ſuch helps, and enjoy fellowſhip, and communion with him, though neglecting them boaſting that we are of Chriſt as well as they, and are not all the Lords people holy? as <hi>Numbers.</hi> 16. 3. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. As immagining that we have no need of them, of their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, advice, prayers, bleſſings, and hands with us, for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100080:52"/>
&amp; mannaging the affaires of the Goſpel pertaining to us but can as well ſtand alone, or go one of our ſelves, even without ſuch of our brethren, as to whom we ought more eſpecially to ſubmit our ſelves in the fear of the Lord, at leaſt, if they will not fulfill our humor, and ſay as we ſay. Or elſe, are we not on the other hand? Idolizing, and preferring them, or ſome one or other of them, before, or in oppoſition to another. As if they had beene crucified for us, or had the ſpirit, to give to us, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or ſome of them, our maſters, or fathers, in ſuch reſpects, as Chriſt ought only ſo to be eſteemed by us, having our eye, &amp; dependance on them, as thoſe that would have our fear regulated &amp; taught by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, yea as the eyes of a Servant, are to his Maſter, and of a Hand-Maid to her Miſtris, and as our eyes ſhould be only unto the Lord. Yea.</p>
            <p>2. The Elders among us, Though its not meete, (eſpecially for ſuch a younger one as my ſelfe) to rebuke ſuch, yet let me entreat them as Fathers, to conſider. Is there not alſo too much of ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as is ruſhing even ſuch into extreames.</p>
            <p>1. Either ſometimes to neglect that great care, and overſight of their brethren, as a thing not partaining to them, or as if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthyneſſe, ſtubborneſſe, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giddineſſe found with us, or any over whom the holy Ghoſt hath made them overſeers, might excuſe the neglect of their care and overſight of them, or give them juſt cauſe to be ſo angry, as to caſt it off. Like <hi>Jeremy</hi> of old, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid, he would ſpeake no more in his name, becauſe it was made a reproach, and diriſion to him daily, But the Lord was ſtronger than he, and prevailed, to beget in him, and carry him forth in a better reſolution. May not likewiſe ſuch follyes, or giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in us, as forementioned, either on the one hand, ſlighting, or on the other hand idolizing ſuch as are over us in the word of the Lord, or being partially puſtup for one againſt another. And not rightly obeying, or ſubmiting to any of them in the Lord, but willfully walking every one in the wayes of his owne heart, and in the fight of his eyes and happily after our owne luſts, heaping up to our ſelves teachers too, having itching eares, I ſay may not ſuch follyes, and giddineſſe found with us, ſometimes move, and provoke the ſpirits even of ſuch as <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be ready to take up ſuch raſh reſolutions, to neglect, or caſt off their care, and watchfullneſſe over their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as if diſengaged; to let them goe on, and walke in their owne way, without plaine and faithfull reproving and warning of the evill of it, as they ſee it, or might ſee it, and have opportunity ſoe to warne them and ſeeke their healing. Yet to ſuch let me ſay be yee entreated, to conſider the nature of your engagement. The grace beſtowed rendring you Deptors, and obliging, and from

and look back towards him who is yet waiting to be gracious to them, and if any by all this goodneſſe yet be aſhamed and ſay I have ſinned and perverted that which is right, and it profited me not, then he is gracious and ſaith, deliver him from going down to the pit, for I have found a ranſome, and he will farther open to him the treaſures and fat things of his Houſe, and lead him into the underſtanding and uſefulneſſe of his truth in Chriſt, and he ſhall returne to the dayes of his youth, as <hi>Ez. k. 43. 10, 11.

            <p>1 He that hath done it, is the only Lord, that hath for ever the onely right to diſpoſe of, and judge us. He even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath committed all judgement to the Son, and executeth all his judgements preſent and eternall by him: even as now in mans nature exalted (as we have ſhewed before) and ſo Jeſus Chriſt as now actually made fleſh in a body prepared for him in our nature, and through ſufferings in the ſame body glorified with the Father, with whom all this was vertually preſent, and of force from the beginning of the world: He even the Man Chriſt Jeſus in the Name of the Father (for all the Scriptures bear witneſſe of him) as it is he that hath done it, as we ſhewed in the ſecond inſtruction propounded to be conſidered in the text, ſo he had the only right to do it, for he is Lord of all, and hath for ever in the name and majeſty of God his Father, the only right to diſpoſe of and

judge us, not only by right of creation, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 7. and 100. 3. for ſo all are his from the beginning, for he was in the beginning with God, and that word was God, by him and for him were all things made that were made, <hi>John 1. 1, 2, 3. Colloſſians</hi> 1. 16. and ſo he is the proper Lord and Heir of all things by right of creation, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his divine and eternall generation, but not only ſo, nor is that all meant in thoſe places in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> forementioned, but alſo by right of redemption (in which there is a new creation for our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made and perfect in him for us) he is Lord of all to the glory and praiſe of God the Father, <hi>Pbill.</hi> 2. 6. 11.</p>
            <p>For when we by reaſon of ſinne were juſtly baniſhed from his Kingdom, in the righteous ſentance of his Law, and equity of his Juſtice, ſhut out as accurſed from him, and by reaſon thereof muſt needs have been le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fied the judgment of this world. That judgment of baniſhment that came on us by the offence one, ſo that his reſurrection was for our juſtification, and by the power of it in the vertue of his ſufferings all men are given him, and all judgment committed to him, and power to execute judgement alſo, becauſe he is the Son of Man, 2 <hi>Samuell</hi> 14 14. with <hi>Hebrews 2. 9. 14. Galatians 3. 13. John 12. 27. 31, 32. &amp; 5. 22. 27. Romans</hi> 5. 18. By him the Kingdome of God is brought unto us; for to this end Chriſt both dyed roſe and revived, that he might be Lord of all: ſo that he is the Lord our God by right of purchaſe and redemption, for he gave himſelfe a ranſome (or price of redemption) for all to be teſtified in due time, and hath obtained an eternall redemption and releaſe of all mankind from under the curſe of the Law, and ſo from under that neceſſary ſlavery to Sin, Death, and Satan, into which we were fallen, ſo that the Father holds no man under that condemnation, or ſentence of baniſhment, as they were fallen under it, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that through him they might be ſaved, and that by him they may be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly judged according to the Goſpell, according to which this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100080:54"/>
is the only condemnation, that when light is come, men love and chooſe darkneſſe rather.</p>
            <p>Therefore to day, while it is called to day, if ye will hear his voyce, harden not your hearts, but let us kneel before the Lord our Maker that hath bought us with the ranſom of his owne body, which the Father prepared him to that purpoſe, for by the vertue of that ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſo by means of his death.</p>
            <p>2 He hath yet power to ſave us, even when by our iniquities and ſinnings againſt the grace of God by him bringing ſalva ion to us we have deſerved to be cut off in his righteous judgement according to the Goſpell, yea when we have procured to our ſelves ſuch judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as in which we are ready to periſh and nigh to cutting off and burning. For by means of his death, he hath obtained power to forgive thoſe ſins that deſerve a ſecond death while it is yet to day, that is before they be ſo finiſhed in any, as to procure the utter blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their names out of the book of the living, and ſo to ſave us from the wrath to come, and hath received gifts for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them, <hi>Hebr. 7. 27. &amp; 9. 15. 1 John 2. 1, 2. 1 Theſſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 10.

            <p>And is therein able to ſave to the utmoſt, them that come to God by him, as well as to hold open the dore for rebellious ſinners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and that he might bring them back from all their wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to God. And all this, becauſe this man continueth for ever in the name and majeſty of God his Father, to improve for us, that one offering of his owne body, by which he hath obtained plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous redemption even the forgiveneſſe of ſins, and in which he live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to appeare in the preſence of God for us. Though good men are periſhed from us, and being taken away by death, can be of no more perſonall uſefulneſſe to us, for the dead know not any thing—nor have any more a portion in any thing that is done under the Sun, and ſo no ſimpathy with us, in our preſent joyes, or griefes nor is there any more that they can doe for us, by ſpeaking to us, or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, for there is no worke, or deviſe, nor knowledge or wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the grave, nor have the dead any capacity, or opportunity to perfect any thing left undone under the Sun. They cannot praiſe him or celebrate his truth to the living, nor hope, or ſeeke for it for them, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 5, 10. Pſal. 6. 5. Iſa.</hi> 38. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Yet the Lord liveth, and bleſſed be the God of the Rock of our Salvation, 2 <hi>Sam. 22. 47. Pſal.</hi> 18. 46. For becauſe he liveth for ever in that body in which he once dyed for us therefore alſo, they that

And therefore alſo, they that waite on him ſhall not be aſhamed, but though they heere paſſe through the vally of the ſhaddow of death, and may ſit in darkneſſe as the fruit of their owne wayes, yet looking to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will be a light to them and his rod, and ſtaffe, ſhall comfort, and uphold them. For he is able to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſupport, preſerve and deliver them, when all other helpers, and Saviours fail from them, even yet to preſerve his Church in the world, as a people to his praiſe, when their power is gone, though thoſe pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars be removed which were a ſtrength to them, and their enemies thought were their only foundations, whence they encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſaying, if the foundations be deſtroyed, what can the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous do.

And therefore will not be wanting in ſeaſonable admonitions to rebellious ones while it is to day, yea will make his rods and reproofes powerfull to the awaking unto his righteouſneſſe, to the giving wiſdome, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the eare to diſcipline; and turning at his reproofe will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power out his ſpirit and make knowne his words, as is ſhewed before, yea he the Lord of the harveſt, will yet raiſe up, and thruſt forth many more faithfull labourers into his vinyard, if yet we be willing to be humbled under his mighty hand, and ſeeke it of him after the due order, for becauſe of his infinite compaſſions, kindneſſe and pitty to man-ward that they may heare of the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne their peace, and learne to know and ſeare his name, therefore he will not make his peculiar people, an utter deſolation in the carth, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
